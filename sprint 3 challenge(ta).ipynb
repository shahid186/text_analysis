      "__label__1 The Backup Plan: Summer reading that does not require much from the reader. I found the plot unbelievable ~ would a guy wait for you for 10 years? They had not even kept in touch as friends! The romance was too predictable. And treatment for PTSD is a far cry from what was described in this story. I skimmed through a good part of this book just to say I finished it. It simply did not hold my interest.\n",

I ended up buying the Linksyswireless-g router for mobile broadband (wrt54g3g-vn)which works well and was priced less. The Linksys did require a software update from the Linksys website.\n",
      "__label__2 A Profound Journey!: Lumari's book, Akashic Records, opened a new way for me to connect with greater wisdom. I immediately felt I was listening to a more intimate conversation with the Keepers of the Akashic. While some books try to explain how to access information from the Akashic, Lumari speaks about the collective itself. In this way, I could feel the energies of the Collective and how they perceive the universe and how they gather the information of life. I felt like I was invited into the Akashic - to listen, to learn and to understand.This book is very interesting and opens a whole new conversation that brought deeper meaning and possibility into my own awareness. The energy quality of this book is excellent! The meditation in this book is a profound journey into greater wisdom and spirit. I highly recommend this book and Lumari's other book, Alawashka, too!\n",
      "__label__1 No relief!: The product information says that it takes at least 30 days for this product to work. At 24 days, I was still removing at least 10 fleas from my dog, per day - the same as before I started using Flea Away. I can't believe that 6 more days would have made any difference. And although the many high-dose B vitamins in the tablets are water soluble (i.e., if the dog gets more than she needs, her body will get rid of it without toxicity), the Vitamin E is not water soluble. Vitamin E can increase bleeding risk and I was a bit worried about my little dog receiving too much of this vitamin. I stopped the pills at 24 days with no relief in sight.\n",

      "__label__1 Alterate time-line for the Marvel mob: Niel Gaiman has created some amazing illustrated fiction, the kind that combines literate storytelling with masterful artwork. I regret that 1602 is not part of that ouvre.If you're a dedicated fan of the X-Men, Nick Fury, Drs. Strange and Doom, the Fantastic Four, and Marvel's other standards, you may well enjoy seeing them all transplanted into the early seventeenth century. I'm afraid that I outgrew my interest in those characters some time back. For me, this looked less like an exploration of the comic medium and more like a mechanical attempt to inject novelty into franchises that desperately need it.If the usual Marvel crowd holds your attention, then go ahead, enjoy. You'll probably find a lot to like here. My interests have moved on.//wiredweird\n",
      "__label__2 No better graphic novel for fans of Marvel and History: By placing some of the best loved Marvel heroes into a historic setting, Gaiman has crafted not only a work of art but also a wonderful playground for some familiar faces to play within.I'll admit, as a Neil Gaiman fan and as a Marvel fan, I was predestined to like this work. If you are either of these things, this is a no-brainer purchase. But even if you are a casual comic fan or simply a fan of good stories, this will be an excellent read and well worth the cover price.It would be difficult to review specifics without ruining something. Suffice to say, some of the best moments come from what would be considered normal events in the Marvel universe and how they are interpreted for the 17th century. I should also mention the artwork is incredible and on par with current comic masterpieces. If all you know is the art that appeared in comics in the eighties, you will relish in this advancement.\n",

The author, who lived in Angola for several years, did a good job of explaining the history of Angola and its people from the first contact with the Portuguese up until the independence. The book explains many of the conflicts Angola has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of colonialism, ethnolinguistic clashes, and the conflict of African and european nationalisms.

He correctly identifies the struggles and interchanges that take place in a fundamentalist Christian home overseas.

      "__label__1 Bad Bad Bad: I had never read a Walter Kirn book before and saw this one at a local bookstore and it looked interesting and it seemed interesting based on what I read standing there. When I got home and started reading it, I was very disappointed.I was so confused and upset because of my confusion that I had a real hard time reading this book. After I finished it, I said \"that is the worst book I have ever read.\"Please don't waste your time or money!\n",
      "__label__1 Nothingness: I wasted $8.00.Rambling writing going nowhere. Expect to see this book as a prop in bookcases at discount furniture stores and in new model homes.If you happen to see the movie it's obvious the screenwriter(s) didn't think much of it either. The plot is similar to the book in only the broadest sense.The author probably doesn't care how his novel was adapted, for the popularity of the movie has likely attracted more suckers like me to buy the book.\n",
      "__label__1 Platinum Disappointment: Up in the Air is perhaps the best written awful book I've ever read. Walter Kirn assembles words well, and he's an astute observer of some aspects of frequent traveling. But the story never reaches a comfortable cruising altitude. There's nothing likeable about Ryan Bingham, his seatmates, the woman he occasionally sleeps with, or the family he grew up with. The several weak plots badly woven throughout the book made me feel like I was sitting on a plane, overhearing parts of several conversations, none of which I cared about. As it droned on like the engine of a 767, it was clear the book had no flight plan.A few pages of this sad, cynical tale might have made a good essay; maybe a few pages more could have been spun into a readable short story. But a novel it's not. And the tired little book certainly isn't worthy of all the publicity it's receiving.\n",
      "__label__1 Smug and tedious novel.: Like many other reviewers, I saw the movie first, liked it, and was interested in reading the book. What a disappointment. I found it pretentious and boring. I wasn't interested in any of the characters, all of whom blended for me since they spoke in the same forced dialogue. The whole book felt like the author was showing off but to no effect. I think you could read something like Twilight 10 times and it wouldn't get as boring as this novel the first time.\n",
      "__label__1 Dark Forces 2 Good, Mysteries of Sith Bad: The Dark Forces may be the best first-person action video game, but it gets Marred by MOS. It was too easy to kill myself in MOS simply by force jumping. I died a hundred times because there was something overhead when I jumped. Once I died because I jumped straight up, but took damage from the fall. Another time I was on this ledge and couldn't get back up--every time I jumped, I would bounce off the wall and die. When I went to several web sites to get help on how to get off that ledge, the best that I could find was 'it is tricky' to get off the ledge. After dying several hundred times I got bored and quit. I've never gone back.\n",

      "__label__2 Great book for ages 4-7: We read this for my daughter's kindergarten book club. It was SO cute! What a great way to get kids excited about reading. The references to great classic children's book and literature enriches an already fun story. Kids will love to see how the animals at the zoo take to reading. Very cute!\n",

It describes the concepts perfectly, concisely for the intermediate/advanced student of Spanish to the language's nuances without causing the reader to reach for the dictionary several times over one page.

The following chapters address la formacion verbal, la formacion nominal y adjetival, formacion pronomial, el lexico: diferencias semanticas, tiempos verbales, y los modos verbales: indicativo y subjuntivo. Whether you're a seasoned veteran with Spanish, or still learning, this book is the best on the market regardless of it being older than a few others. The one drawback is that it does NOT use international phonetic symbols, but anyone with some light familiarity with the international symbols will be able to crack this book in no time.\n",
      "__label__2 Well researched: My wife and I helped Rob with some of the research for the book while we were living on the island of Raiatea in 1994. Most travel writers can only spend a little time actually checking out places to stay and eat. With the research that we were able to do, the reader of this book can be assured that the information hotels, pensions and restaurants on Huahine, Raiatea, Tahaa and Maupiti are not only accurate but informed by our personal experiences during a stay of several months.\n",

I was eager to try out the recipes and I thought I start with the Raddish Cake. To my horror, the instructions were unclear! The author did not mention what to do with the raddish! Luckily, I had another book which has a perfect recipe for it. A few days later, I thought I try the Crystal Duck Dumplings and although I followed the instructions perfectly, the dough did not turn out well at all. I think it would be a long time before I would ever try any of the recipes again. Maybe I am just not good at making dim sum.\n",

I can imagine the small firm she works in is actually a positive place to hang your hat. (This must be fiction *smiling*.)Not only is the writing thoroughly engaging and entertaining, the subject matter is one we can all relate to - in all its horrifying glory.What worked especially well was the ending.

Africa is huge, and the idea that every square inch of this country he is in is swarming with the undead is highly unlikely especially due to the fact that I can low crawl faster than these zombies walk.

In the end a curse is broken that binds the dead mages to this realm.I love the combination of technology and magecraft. High tech verses an agrigarian society. I see the writers soap box platform on saving our old growth forest. I live in the pacific north west and have experienced it a lot and agree.I look forward to his next book. I find him a fascinating writer with thoughtful insight and three deminsional characters. A real flare for style.\n",

The first book may have been good, but Coe failed to expand on any of the magic systems, characters, or subplots that had potential to make this book interesting. The magic system was vague (which is fine for a first novel, but by the conclusion I want some explanation) and unimaginative, as were many of the characters. The book's outcome was extaordinarily predictable. If you have liked this series so far, don't destroy your image with this book.\n",

I don't know whether his vocals have improved or if he has just learned to sing slightly different to match the change in pitch. In my opinion this album as a whole, contains his best music in twenty years. None of the songs stand-out above the rest, but they are all solid. His past 5-6 studio albums contain 1-2 great songs surrounded by very bland ones. Recent albums may have had good lyrics, but the music doesn't stand up to the standards Merle has set in the past. \"Chicago Wind\" is an surprisingly wonderful exception to this.It is a shame that most C&W; radio stations will never play any songs that make their listeners think about political, social, economic or environmental issues.\n",

It also is a MUST for non-fliers who might like insight into those individuals who lived during an era when aviators were heroes.Kershner's crisp collection of events from his career will appeal to all who have any fascination for the sheer fun and wonder of flight.\n",

SURPRISE! It wasn't the hardware, it was the CD. I own thousands of CDs and have never, ever heard a recording this poorly engineered and presented. That sent me back to listen to the Amazon samples.

Honestly you have to go into this movie with an open mind and free time because it's slower paced. Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting was really phenomenal and passionate as well.

I had the misfortune of seeing this movie today with my husband and we both couldn't believe what a horribly written and misogynistic movie this was! Literally people were walking out left and right. The movie attempts to create an engaging storyline that leaves the viewer disgruntled and confused.

If you want fun and little more sweat, I would suggest Carmen Electra's striptease workout.

The essence of the book, a deep and evocative exploration of a father and son relationship, is beautifully captured in the film. The premise, a cross country trip to deliver the National Tree to the President's lawn is well rendered; Andrew McCarthy and Andrew Williams do a superb job. But in an hour and a half, the quirkiness and delight of the novel could not be completely explored.

In the meantime, Brianne's horrible step father promises her hand in marriage to someone else and Brianne will do everything she can to keep from marrying this evil man, with the help of Peirce if he gets over his wife's death.

As far as the recipes go, it is great- they have different ice cream bases, and suggest in each recipe which base works best for flavor. They also have recipes for sorbets, toppings (fudge, caramel, etc), and other desserts that can be used as add ins (brownies, blondies, etc). It also, obviously, doesn't talk about frozen yogurt.

If they sang along in the same cadence and/or pitch they were deemed drunk enough and were served no more but applauded for their efforts.This is actually a product of two very talented people who probably had a struggle with singing and playing terribly.I have been looking for LPs of this for 30 yrs at flea markets, garage sales, etc.....it is here at Amazon that I found it. I am extremely gratified. It has helped me separate the chaff from the wheat in the \"friend\" department!!!!\n",

      "__label__2 Different Battles is a fascinating read.: Different Battles is a truly unusual book. It's a meticulously researched, vividly imagined historical study. But it's also a moving personal memoir--all the more powerful for being understated. On top of all that, it's a fascinating read.The author grew up in Vero Beach, Florida during World War II when German subs were a greater threat along the U.S. East coast than most people realized. The boy's father, Kit Johnson, uses his fishing boat to search for and rescue the survivors of ships torpedoed by the Germans. He later fights a very \"different battle\" with Alzheimer's. Peter Cremer, the charismatic and somewhat enigmatic Commander of a German U-boat, captures the reader's imagination. But as we gradually come to realize, the author's father is the real hero of the book.\n",

I encourage you to read this book and just enjoy the beauty of how much God loves us.\n",
      "__label__2 Simply Divine: This book provides an excellent insight into a humble soul truly united with Christ. It's an inspiration to re-examine our own lives to see the how we can unite our sufferings with the Lord and allow Christ to work through us. It also reinforces the message of God's Divine Mercy and God's desire to shower us with His mercy when many may think we do not derserve it or even want it. While we can never merit God's mercy, He truly was working through St. Faustina to spread his message that he wants to give his Mercy to all who accept Him and to the whole world which is in so desperate need of Mercy. Reading this book will make you look at things differently and it is a grace to read.\n",

If you want his best work, buy his spanish albums -- Amazon has all of them (kudos). He somehow loses the passion and energy on this album. If you like latin-influenced pop music, watered down for an American audience that is too narrow minded to listen to lyrics in other languages, then you will like this album and the other \"latin craze\" music (Martin, Iglesias, Lopez). Latin music has been around forever; it is a shame that Americans think it is now \"the rage\" because a few English albums with latin beats have been released. In other countries, the music scene is much more international...\n",

      "__label__2 Riding The Waves: Marc Anthony has hopped on a shiny pop music train with his self-titled English debut. While longtime fans wont find much of the salsa here that they've always known him for, there's still plenty of continuity in the fact that he's as fine a singer as ever and a sure romantic.Then again, Marc Anthony has always been about putting his own spin on his roots, so would-be critics should be warned--he wont be tied down. The single I Need to Know, with its pulsing salsa horns and piano, was a ubiquitous item on mainstream radio that clearly rode the fast waters of the Latin floodgate opened by Ricky Martin (Anthony used to sing back up to Menudo)and others.Thats Okay delves a bit deeper into the clave, while the plaintive How Could I combines the fluid fire of Spanish guitar with soft, slow-jam programming. A sweet pop nugget, You Sang to Me offers soaring waves of keyboard as Anthony makes his amorous declarations with breathy urgency.Sexy, salsa king rides the crossover wave.\n",

      "__label__2 A film about patriotic duty vs. love: Based on a famous Thai novel by Tommayanti, Sunset At Chaopraya (aka Khu Gam) has been made into a multilingual film.Set in Thailand during WWII; it's a story about Kobori, a Japanese soldier who unquestioningly takes command of an army base in a region called Thonburi as instructed by his superiors, but finds himself emotionally struggling with his new role and his sense of duty, as well as his deep attraction for a Thai woman named, Angsumalin.Overall, a pretty good film for those who like emotional rollercoasters. Initially, the beginning is slow, but as it progresses, you want to know how it turns out. Kind of reminds you of a certain Jane Austen story, but to mention the name would spoil the film.\n",

I don't even like Cameron Diaz but in this she does GREAT!not one for kids though! I still won't let mine watch but I'm strict like that.\n",
      "__label__1 terrible.: 1st off, Cameron Diaz was grossly miscast in this role. There were probably dozens of actresses who could have played this role better (how does she keep getting job after job after job?? She's an AWFUL actress - at best).Now i like funny and sexy as much as anyone. But these \"jokes\" were just downright crude and not even a little bit funny. This makes the Seth Rogen-type comedies look like Gone With the Wind.Although all the roles were bad, Justin Timberlake did the best job in his, rising slightly above the rest of the pig slop, proving he was actually too good to lend his name to this trash.Its lucky to get a one-star rating here, as you can't dish out zero stars.

To keep this short, I will not be watching this movie again.\n",

Not surprised that there are more 1 star ratings for this than 4 stars. Can't believe C Diaz actually read the script before shooting this and still continued. Her career is really in a tailspin after this kind of crap. There's the good part of Hollywood, and then there's this. If Amazon had a way to award 1/2 star that's what it's worth. Maybe not even that much. What's next for Diaz... a TV sitcom? Wouldn't be surprised.\n",
      "__label__2 surprisingly funny: Yes this movie is raunchy and over the top, but I loved it. There are awkward parts and it is R rated for a reason, but this is the best comedy I've seen all year. Don't take it seriously and you'll love it!\n",

Desiring breast implants, she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores. Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film.

The only reason I watched to the end was to see how much worse it could continue to get. The great Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal are totally wasted. The gorg Cameron Diaz should fire her agent. Do yourself a favor and run away from this humorless turd.\n",
      "__label__1 Bad? More like terrible...: There was nothing fun or funny about this movie (I knew the reviews weren't good, but I thought there had to be at least some enjoyable parts -- I was wrong). There was no chemistry between Cameron and the PE teacher. I couldn't tell if Justin T's character was that ridiculous or if it was just really poor acting. There were zero likeable characters and no character development. From watching the movie, I had no understanding as to why the main character was so nasty to everyone. Did something happen to her as a child? A little background would be nice. Overall, pointless.\n",

      "__label__1 Should be rated X: First of all, to anyone that thinks this movie is supposed to be deep, realistic and taken seriously; don't. I don't believe it was meant to be taken seriously, however it's still not funny. Yea, it has a few giggle moments here & there but most of the scenes made no sense. Weak Plot. Too many scenes that tried too hard. It wasn't necessarily boring but simply not funny.The dry humping scene was extra, totally unnecessary. The teachers other than Cameron Diaz were torture to watch. Seems like a lot of things were just thrown together at the last minute from the producer.I recommend ages 18 & older only to watch, anyone younger is just inappropriate. It suits young adults who need a brainless movie to watch while high on marijuana.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointing: I couldn't muster enough faith in the story to prod any longer than page 41. I found it difficult to relate to, sympathize with, or even respect the characters. They were intolerable, existing only to drive the plot. The book professes to extol the principles of cultural tolerance and individual sensitivity, but it fails in this as it attempts to bridge ethnic, gender, racial, economic, generational, and, especially, the individual divide.The characters are pigeonholed in stereotyped behavior, manner, and thought. A stilted performance of a highly advertised and acclaimed book.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointing - Anne Tyler Seems to Have Lost Her Joy: I was most disappointed with this new book from Anne Tyler. And I would agree with some of the other reviewers who think she's lost her special gift. Her characters have lost their endearing quirky edge and their sense of humor. (Who can ever forget the man who washed his dress shirts at the end of his day by stomping around on them while taking a shower? Or the family that always put the groceries away in exact alphabetical order. I could go on an on.) In her last few books, however,her characters have pretty much fallen flat. I fear that this change to more serious, humorless stories is a relection of her own life. It seems that since her husband died, her stories have suffered. I hope she will rediscover her old witty, truly joyful view of life and bring us back some of her mesmerizing quirky characters. I await her next book with great hope.\n",
      "__label__2 Good book: Digging to America by Anne Tyler is a most enjoyable read. Our book club is usually into heavy stuff, and it was delightful to read something that wasn't a \"downer.\"Anne Tyler writes simply and directly. She can capture a scene and emotion with few, articulate, well chosen words. I laughed out loud at the binky party.The main character is really Maryam who is searching for \"belonging\" as is almost everybody else in the book.You'll enjoy this book, It's not a GREAT book, but one that can generate some good discussion.\n",
      "__label__1 Boring: I have to rank this with the top ten most boring books I have ever read. It's my first Anne Tyler book and there would have to be a pretty good argument for picking up another of her books. The characters in this book were so uninteresting. I couldn't connect with one character. Practically the whole book is about planning a party or attending a party. After the first party I pretty much decided that attending a party with these people would be torture! The underlying themes had the promise of making this an explosive book, but they were just left dead on the pages while the characters and parties bored me to tears.\n",
      "__label__1 Great writer, but surprisingly dull and uninvolving book: I've read every Anne Tyler book and usually enjoy them and always find them readable.But this one (I haven't finished it yet) isn't very compelling. A week or more goes by before I pick it up and I think I'm just going to have to set aside a few hours and \"get it out of the way\" which is a horrible thing to say about a writer I enjoy so much.Neither the characters nor the plot are compelling to me -- just seems like dinners and lunches at one anothers homes. The characters--her strong point--seem flat and without a strong plot to move things along...it just ain't moving along.\n",
      "__label__1 Characters In Search of a Plot: As an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction about the transracial adoptive experience, I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this book. However, I was disappointed and surprised at how the author failed to create momentum or at the very least, a forward moving plot. Much description was given with no action, mainly reading like the background biographies of the characters rather than details that are integrated into a developed story. Most distressing is the lack of three dimensionality to the children themselves, a list of physical attributes and behavioral tics do not make them come alive. I am a true sucker for any kind of family formed by adoption story, let alone one with the outlines of this book as it mirrors my own family, but the fact that I didn't feel moved at all signals to me, an unconvincing and inauthentic rendition of this experience.\n",
      "__label__2 Romance & Politics: The Devil's Paw, a novel of espionage and intrigue during World War I, is very dated in light of subsequent historical events, but it is facinating nonetheless. There is a moderate amount of suspense and action from the main characters, but the thrust of the novel is a study of the political climate of England at that time. Julian Orden, son of a British aristocrat and vocal espouser of the Socialist cause attends a dinner party and meets Catherine, a young woman of mixed antecedents--British and Russian. In her face he recognizes the person who saved his life on the beach the night before. These two characters become caught up in a plan by the leaders of the working people of Germany and England to force a premature end to World War I. I enjoyed this book, but unless you are interested in the philosophy of British politics and the position of Socialism in that era, I would suggest another choice.\n",

      "__label__1 Biased writer: This book was required for one of my courses while earning my teacher certification. I noticed that the author works at my university so I'm not too surprised that it was required and not just recommended. The author, Mark Ryan, is very biased in his view of education. To him there is no place in a classroom for traditional teaching styles. It should be an open, student-directed learning environment where the teacher is a \"guide on the side\". My 8th grade daughter is suffering through this type of teaching right now and I can tell you that leaning too much one way or the other isn't good. When will the education community learn to use a little bit of all types of teaching philosophies rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water?If required to read this text, do so with a grain of salt.

      "__label__1 I didn't love it.: This story of Grace O'Rourke and Rathe Bragg was my second-least favorite book of the very talented Brenda Joyce. The absolute worst was Runaway Bride, which I didn't bother to finish after just a few chapters.This book was very unsatisfying and highly predictable. While Rathe was somewhat interesting, Grace was very stereotypical and cliche, in my opinion. Most of Joyce's fans look to her to really make the pages sizzle with passionate heat, and sadly, this book fell short and it fell HARD. None of the love scenes were endearing or worthwhile. Is this the same author that wrote The Fires of Paradise?On a more positive note, Joyce's use of the deep south during the horrible aftermath of slavery was a very promising backdrop for an excellent story. The plot did not stand up to the setting, and the \"romance\" between the main characters was dry and inspired very little emotion from the reader. If you love stories set in the deep south, you may be able to find some enjoyment out of it.\n",

This book touched me as it was a combination of Ms. Vanzant's personal anguish, trial and tribulations as well as her own victories coupled with the thought-provoking inspiration for which she is famous. INTERIORS is a story of one woman's personal journey through some of life's darkest valleys and in facing these demons, she rises like a phoenix into the realm of self-actualization, self-love and most importantly, self-respect.Although INTERIORS is an autobiographical journey of Iylanla Vanzant's life, it can be applicable to anyone who has experienced pain in their own life.

Anyway, here's the turn off and let's fast forward to the scene when he told Eliza's cousin(the villain) to leave England permanently and even suggested to settle in France. Then on the epilogue, he was telling her about a job that would require them to live in France? How stupid was that?

The fold-down wheels at the feet just look silly. His telescoping sword is a cheap cop-out for a weapon, along with his spoiler supposedly doubling as a shield. The grey plastic looks horribly dull.

One of the legs broke away under stress after a month of use, and because of the design, is all but unrepairable without adding unsightly screws or straps for support. The legs have notches which slide in to grooves in the bottom of the center pole, and the notch on the leg is thin and easily breaks away. Also, the base of the coat tree is too narrow which causes it to topple over if the weight is unevenly distributed.

      "__label__1 This music requires an almost supernatural technique...: Composer Godowsky has beautifully augmented the Etudes of Chopin, adding textures and even extra melody lines, with just two hands expected to somehow play it all. Carlo Grante is a very good pianist, but this music requires amazing dexterity. This is a noble attempt, but too often Grante is forced to break the rhythm and fluidity of the pieces in order to accomodate the extra material. Many of the pieces are simply played too slowly. Imagine Chopin etudes plodding like dinosaurs, like someone's got a thumb on the record! Marc-Andre Hamelin has the supernatural technique to play these pieces well. Grante plays some of the studies well enough. It's interesting to hear him attempt some of the most complex pieces ever written. But perhaps he needs another few years of practice. Someone wrote that Grante has re-recorded these pieces for release this year. It should be VERY interesting to see what eight extra years of practice has yielded!\n",
      "__label__1 Nonsense.: Grante has no idea at all of style appropriate to this idiom. Most of these are unrecognizable. No sense of texture, tone, legato, or anything else that would have meant anything to Godowsky. Check out Godowsky's American records, e.g. the Berceuse, (not the Columbias) to hear what I mean. As bad as I've heard since Szidon's hysterical Scriabin or Pollini's brutal Chopin. No bueno. Really no stars at all.\n",
      "__label__2 Good place to start: Although a bit outdated (especially s far as examples and tables are concerned) this book is still a good starting point for those who wants to begin with their research in astro economics and astro trading: for example, if you have never read an Ephemeris table before then section two of the book will explain you how to do it. One important point: this book makes reference to moving planets \"aspects\" and their correlation with turning points in the market: it has little to do with financial astrology , here you will not find corporations' horoscopes, first trade dates or stuff like that. Another observation: this books is very simple to understand: the author writes about astronomical cycles without mentioning equations, signals theory and celestial mechanics concepts, great for beginners, maybe this a limit for those more into this subject.\n",

      "__label__1 Technical Errors: There are so many books 'how-to' books out there on mosaic technique. Some are accurate, clearly based on extensive practical knowledge and experience, and some have very misleading and incorrect information. I'm afraid this book falls in the former category. When an author mentions using Elmers craft glue to create a mosaic or seal a substrate, then I would hesitate to trust any of the other information in the book.For a proven 'how-to' book on creating mosaics, I would suggest 'Mosaic Techinques and Traditions' by Sonia King or any of the books by Emma Biggs, Tessa Hunkin, or Elaine Goodwin. These are all working mosaic artists and instructors and the techniques they share can be counted on to provide you with a solid foundation in this wonderful art form.\n",
      "__label__2 Great calming liquid: I got a rescue dog and for the first few days he was very difficult. When I left he would bark and howl for hours. My rescue contact suggested that I try Good Boy. After one day of adding it to his water, he became totally different. Slept like a baby while I was gone and when I got home was back to normal. It seemed like I was drugging him b/c it was so effective. But he is very normal and active whenever I was around. Odd. After a few days I decided to stop putting it in his water b/c I was worried that it was too much. But after that, he just stayed calm all the time. I think it helped him make the transition to being in a new house with a new owner. Ever since then, he has been just fine and not hyper active anymore. It really saved the day for me! (and him...) I recommended it to my friends with over-active dogs and I'm waiting to hear what they say after they buy it for their dogs.\n",

This Album is a great master piece and has the collaboration of such great composers as the argentine composer Bebu Silvetti and His Mexican compatriot The master of such hits as \"It's impossible\", \"Adore\", and \"Yesterday I heard the rain\", the legendary Armando Manzanero. This album celebrates love and not sexuality. The songs that stand out in this album are \"Sol arena y mar\", \"o tu y ninguna\", \"Quiero\" Dimelo en un Beso\" and \"Tu solo Tu.\" This album is a combination of pop/Jazz/ballad/classical woven together.

The second generation Decoding Society, guitarist Cary DeNegris, bassist Reginald Washington, violinist Akbar Ali and saxaphonist Eric Person on this recording persons in conjunction with African singers/percussionists Twins Seven Seven. The result of the collaboration, while interesting, lacks much of the fire that the older Decoding Society had.By and large the pieces are invested in funky African rhythms, they have a nice sound, the playing is good all around (particularly Washington, who adds a good slap funk sensibility and slithers nicely between Jackson's rhythms), but there's by and large something really quite unfulfilling about the record. It just doesn't burn. The band did much better work, this is a curiosity piece more than having any intrinsic value.\n",

In nay case, this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted (emails only) and it's hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it. The central plot was a romance, a triangle romance, where the heroine is caught between 2 lovers. It wasn't a really good book and I wouldn't recommend it.

Second, the book does essentially NOTHING - a very slow, boring, tedious, and pointless \"build\" - until the last 100 pages (out of 480 is ridiculous). It really isn't building much. It could have been said easily in 150 pages vs 380. All-in-all, I would chalk this up to a bunch of people reviewing being a little downsy, as well as ridiculous. Anyone that says this is \"scary!\" or \"terrifying!\" shouldn't read horror novels whatsoever. I've read my share of horror fiction, and this is easily the worst and least scary.\n",

Everyone seemed to be caricatures of one fault or another, including the father and daughter. In all honesty, my opinion of almost every book or movie rests with the abilty to care about at least one character. In this book, I found no one. I was turned off by every person in the story. And as for the chills, I did not see what the other reviewers saw.I have never been one to put someone off of something. But this time I just had to write something down. Judging by all of the other reviews, I am in the extreme minority. I may give another of Tamara Thorne's novels a try. It may have just been this particular book.\n",

      "__label__2 A Wiersbe classic that all should read: Christianity is a relationship between God and each believer, with Jesus being the mediator (First Timothy 2:5). That relationship sometimes breaks down because we frail humans always want to take the easy way out. The easy way out is to make rules about how we should live, such as \"never drink alcohol\" and \"never go to movies.\" Wiersbe explains why rules like those are detrimental to a believer's growth. He explains in simple but precise ways that the Law of Moses was intended to cause each of us to realize two things: (1) we cannot please God by following the Law because we can't follow the Law (2)and the Law was designed to teach us that we need a savior from the Law. That savior is none other than Jesus, the mediator between a holy God and unholy mankind. Wiersbe's book is simply a great book. Read it and Be Free!\n",

To my knowledge the new James Bond Series does it most...and best. However there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed..sadly 12 rounds is one of them. The moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action, or an actual by stander to it..and does work sometimes. The problem with 12 rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film. This film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie.

      "__label__2 Surprisingly moving: Although a documentary, it was a surprisingly moving and warm film. The main character, the faithful monk Tenzin, is very likable, and your heart goes out to him when he expresses doubt that he is up to the task of finding his teacher's new incarnation. There is a scene where he revisits his late teacher's now-abandoned and ruined retreat home, and he is overwhelmed with sorrow and begins to cry. Depictions like that abound in this film - moments of touching human-ness that make you realize that people are the same all over the world. There are also moments of joy, like the scene where Tenzin and his reincarnated master, now a very young boy, are both trying as fast as they can to make bottles of soda pop foam up and spill out over the glass. This is not a story about Buddhism as much as it is a story about love.\n",

      "__label__1 My last Koontz book for a while......: I have found Koontz to be a masterful storyteller in all of the books that I have read by him (Phantoms, Watchers, From the Corner of His Eye, Intensity), but this book was horribly and unnecessarily wordy and cumbersome. The desriptions of everything from the lawn to the moonight were ridculously lengthy and the dialogue throughout was unrealistic and misguided. Pray that this book comes out as a movie, b/c it will take you MUCH longer than two hours to needle through.Wanna read a wonderful book? Try \"The Weight of Water\" by Anita Shreve....it's wonderful!\n",
      "__label__2 Great reading!: This is a great mix of scenes, all convulging on the same story. The characters are so well-written, that as the story unfolds, you cry with them, laugh with them, are driven to experience all of their emotions, amazements and frustrations as if you were with them all the time.Very excellent reading.\n",
      "__label__1 Slow and tedious: I have always enjoyed Koontz and his books, but this is too long, and wordy. In paperback it was 681 pages, it could have been done under 400. It is a rambling and tedious book to read. While I felt I should put it down, I skimmed it, and still got the story. I am one who could have easily put it down at any time. I guess a great author gets his name, and then can write anything and it will be a best seller.\n",

It is EXTREMELY choppy, bouncing back and forth with no real story plot. I am 1/2 way through (has taken over 2 months) and there still is no rhyme or reason to this book. If you love Koontz, I think you'll be disappointed. I was. My husband is almost done with the book and says it doesn't get any better....\n",

This story reminds us of what is truly important in this life and to not identify people by their limitations. It's laugh out loud funny at times and definitely keeps you turning the pages. He really gives you an insight into the daily lives and tribulations of ordinary people you might otherwise ignore and depicts them in bizarre circumstances at times that give them an opportunity to show their inner strength in a truly memorable way.

In comparison to \"Ticktock\" or \"Watchers\" or a host of others, this one is a real sleeper. Sometimes I scan a chapter and see nothing, then go back to read it in detail and find the same. What a disappointment. Pick another one of Koontz's books. Not this one.\n",

She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old.

First of all the face was copper not white (as shown) which made it hard to see the time from a distance. This was not a problem however because it stopped keeping the correct time after a couple of weeks. It never stopped completely but the time would vary from 2 to 5 hours off everyday. It was almost a joke to see what time \"Broke Ben\" would say when we went out. If it had been my $9.00 Walmart special this all would be funnier. I'm glad to see this item is currently unavailable.

      "__label__1 Dissapointment is an understatement: I got this game as a birthday, and was very excited to try it out. Needless to say I played the game for nearly a week before giving up completely.The idea behind it is great. An MMORPG that doesn't revolve around killing endless amounts of rats and pigs to level up. It promoted party-based adventuring to the extreme. The modules/quests were self-contained. Everything seems just great.But the execution for this game is extremely poor. The quests just aren't much fun. The combat system is ok. The way leveling is done doesn't make much sense, especially for a game based on D&D.;I dunno, I found this game extremely boring (even for an MMORPG). This game was my second time trying games in the MMORPG genre, and it'll definitely be my last...Don't waste your money.\n",

The latter was true, but the more I got into this book, the more I actively disliked the main character, Alma. A growing dislike of the character made it hard to plow through this long and overly detailed book. The author, in my opinion, wasted my time on needless, and seemingly endless details that added nothing to the story for me but pages, time, and effort.Though the book apparently appeals to some, it was an experience in reading drudgery for me.

But I don't and can't do these \"Things\". Always when I read such kind of books, I am firm about trying to do these \"Things\".

I was directed to purchase this book by a professor who was a student of Layton. I wanted to better understand the gnostic traditions and this book works to explain the gnostic mind in mind-numbing detail. The western, Enlightenment conditioned mind will not easily understand these scriptures because they don't exist in the rubric of rationalism. They are mythology. The gnostic scriptures are more like reading Hesiod's Theogony or Ovid's Metamorphoses than the New Testament. If your goal is to truly understand gnosticism Layton is indespensible. However, if all you want is a general understanding of gnostics, avoid this book. It will only muddy the water. You have been warned.\n",

What I found was absolute drivel.

It tells lies about the homosexual community and it keeps homophobia going.

I believe the best book out there that best tackles this topic called \"Dirt, Greed and Sex\" by William L. Countryman.For those that read the book and stated that they are scared of what \"agenda\" the homosexual community has, its beyond me. People do not do enough research and/or reading.

Again given the price this is to be expected. The paper towels themselves are fair to poor in absorbancy thus my lower rating.

There are plenty of them in this book, but as a decorating guide, I found it a little too rich for my taste. Some rooms are over the top, and some, to me, are hideous! But taste is a very individual thing. Rachel Ashwell's Shabby Chic books are more my style, I think.\n",

I agree that it is a wonderful book as the antithesis of potterybarn and restoration hardware living that is enough to kill anyone with an independant idea- and while the author's style is too fussy for me, I love the text and the pace of the book. I would highly recommend it to someone who believes in interior decoration as a theory, a passion, if not a practicality.\n",

It is way, way too overdone for my taste, and in no way does it reflect any element of french style that I've seen. I'd consider myself a francophile, but even Versailles looks restrained in comparison to Strasser's layers upon layers upon layers. I'd hate to clean in any of these rooms. There are some good ideas, like the rinceau treatment of the warehouse room turned parlor, but they were largely hidden under swaths of satin and clutter. I'd hoped for more depictions of true french designs.\n",

One was about schools taking out soda machines and putting in water and healthier drinks, but still having McDonald's and Burger King which is even less healthy.Chew on This was not my favorite book. I am a vegetarian so the meat part made me gag. The book takes a long time to read; it feels like forever. The things that I don't like are when they explain how they kill a chicken and that pink lemonade is really made from bugs. I know that the facts are disgusting, but it is awesome how bugs can turn lemonade pink. The purpose of writing the book is to convince the customers not to eat at fast food restaurants. I suggest that you only read this book if you like reading about disgusting things.Adrienne F.Grade 6Ms. Kawatachi\n",

The second CD is my favorite of the two, I recommend tracks 4, 9 and 11 -all of which were discovered while napping on the train to work. I also recommend Darey's Ibiza release within the Euphoria collection.at best: you have a CD with mellow tunes to chill to, and plenty of thumping sets to throw parties withat worst: you'll find a few no-namer DJs with good sound that might be worth checking out on MP3\n",

My favorite song on the album is \"Protocol\". It kicks serious donkey. I've had this CD for close to 4 years and it hasn't got old yet. Although it is hard to make out thru all of the scratches and battle scars. And it has one of those f*cking sun spots that looks like a kid stood over it with a magnifying glass and burned a hole thru it. I need to get it again. And again if need be. And yes, even again, after it has been mangled 5 or 6 times, I will still get it again. Well, after two times, I'll probably just steal it off of the internet.

The acronym WTLM is used in almost every ad, but is never explained. The ads themselves are creative, but I wouldn't consider most of them humorous.

Can you imagine that there are any significant facts, details, insights in so few pages? Well, you're right--there aren't! What we do have are stereotypes (dirty old king, lusty Chaucerian wench, stupid courtiers, etc.). What is most egregious is that there is never even an attempt to explain why and how Catherine and her cohorts could have made so many stupid mistakes, how they could behave as if there had never been an Anne Bolyn: that's the mystery that has always fascinated me about Henry's \"rose without thorns,\" but you'll find no answers here.

Over time (about 4 months I would guess)my hair has taken on a bluish tint. The person cutting my hair noticed first (I get my hair cut about once a month). Then my wife noticed. The bluish tint began so slowly, I really didn't notice, much to my chagrin and self admonishment. But, when called to my attention, my hair clearly had the faint bluish tint. I have now changed shampoos after years of Crew use. I suspect it is something in the formula that was changed over the last year or so.

We should be speaking of an influx of traditions found in Thomas into Gnosticism, not the influx of Gnosticism into Thomas.

There is a fascinating section, The Monty Keen Experiment, and the results seem extremely remarkable -- why isn't it published in Science Magazine?

Sorry, finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground is not proof that our bodies are \"vibrating\" or that finding that ticket was based on positive thinking.Be careful of any writing that proclaims something a \"Universal Law\" that clearly isn't.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big proponent of positive thinking and I feel it is helpful. But the author is stealing your money by selling you false claims, fantasies, and untruths.Why would you spend your hard-earned money on a lie?\n",
      "__label__2 Simple, fast way to change your thinking: This book is for the \"terrible two's\" child within us. \"I don't like this, I don't like that!\" It forces you to ask the simple question...\"Well what do you want?\" Amazingly, adults may need to be reminded to of this. The book goes on to develop techniques to answer the question and implement solutions. As others have written, may not be a major revelation, but the author provides a reminder to discipline the inner child in straightforward manner that will get results.\n",

      "__label__1 dissappointed: I do believe the Audio CD would have been way better if narrated by Mike Losier himself. Instead, you hear Hugh Gallager's narration which is monotone and lacking inspiration. So dissappointed in his choice of narration, I would probably reccomend buying the book instead.\n",

      "__label__1 A whole book for one simple concept!: I thought the book was way too basic. There were many exercises that you had to do and write about in the book. I thought most of it was there simply to fill up space since the main idea could be explained on one page. I am giving it two stars instead of one because after all, the author did try to write a book explaining how the Law of Attraction works. Two of my favorite books talking about the Law of Attraction are \"Ask and It Is Given\" by E. Hicks and \"How To Be Wildly Wealthy Fast\" by S. Forster.\n",
      "__label__2 A Simple Clear Guide to Manifestation: I really enjoyed this book because it was brief, direct, concrete and offered clear worksheets that you could personalize (for yourself or for coaching clients). I think the inner work of changing your beliefs and vibration is very important in manifestation. The one thing I would have liked included was an emphasis on action as well-ie: 'I am a famous actor AND I am actively applying for auditions.' Many Law of Attraction books seem to leave out this action part.\n",

The only set back is, it didn't cover fully enough on certain family, esp. my favorite ones such as, Dendrobium, Vanda, Renanthera, and Cymbidium as lots of species seen to be missing in the encyclopedia. Never theless, this is a great book and strongly recommanded for everyone; with many reference to the photos.\n",

Of course, nothing substitutes for some good, old-fashioned soul-searching, but Dr. Freeman's book will certainly kick your inner dialogue into gear.What impressed me most about this book was the quality of information--everything was accurate, up-to-date, and written in an engaging way. I learned many things about each of the specialties I am consdering that I'd never read anywhere else. I also appreciated the fact that each specialty chapter is written by someone who's actually \"been there, done that\"--they're all written by residents.Overall, I highly recommend this book to any medical student who is pondering what specialty to choose.\n",

It does a fine job of explaining several different techniques, and shows you how to implement them.It's light on the theory side, so if you're more interesting in the \"why\" than the \"what\", you may want to choose a different book. One exception to this is the explanation of arithmetic coding and statistical methods, which can actually be read and understood in one pass.\n",
      "__label__1 Sounds like a typical movie soundtrack album...: I admit it. I read all the extremely positive reviews, and was duped into thinking that this album was somehow set apart from all other movie soundtracks. So, I ran out, and purchased it. However, after listening to it, I was truly disappointed. There is nothing striking or significant about this piece. The movie is outstanding, and the music within the movie context is fitting. However, extract the music from the movie, and what you have are 10 tracks that all sound about the same. To sum it up in one word...boring. Now, if your interested in powerful, moving music that stands apart, might I suggest the Schindler's List Soundtrack...the violin solos by Itzhak Perlman are truly outstanding.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointing: I ordered this movie going off the other reviewers on Amazon and boy was I wrong. It was long, cheesy and just pure uninteresting. The casting was done well and Hritik and Sanjay really played their parts but that was the only saving grace.There was a song and dance number every-time you turned around. While they were mediocre in nature, they did not help advance the story line in any shape or form. The story itself is far fetched and is not fathomable by any stretch.\n",
      "__label__1 Fram is poor quality: The standard Fram oil filters are considered one of the poorest quality oil filters on the market. They have cardboard internal end caps and irregular filter medium held together by clips. These are constructed in Canada and quality control doesn't seem all that good.

I used Fram for years, but will not buy any more after seeing these dramatic comparisons!\n",

I thoroughly enjoyed the color section in the middle of the book and reading about the director and production of the expensive series. The DVD that came with it was fun but long winded at times when the interviewees went into what they 'believed' to be Frank Herbert's desires. But how could they know? Anyway, a good book for the Dune fan to pick up.\n",

      "__label__1 DOES NOT WORK WITH PS3!!: I recently purchased this product with the expectation that I would be able to plug in the adapter and instantly use my Guitar Hero guitars. This was not the case. When I got the adapters, the first thing I noticed was the packaging which stated the product was a \"PS2 to USB (PC)\" adapter. The PS3 has USB ports so I thought this wouldn't be a problem. However, upon plugging the adapter in, I found it wouldn't register the guitars. After further investigation and several minutes of frustration, I noticed a disc included in the packaging marked \"Drivers\". Obviously this presented a problem as the drivers had to be loaded in order to use the adapters. As I haven't yet found a way to load drivers in to the programming of the PS3, I was unable to use the adapters with the console. Bottom line: Don't buy these adapters for use with you PS3. There are adapters out there that are specifically made for the PS3 and work for that application.\n",

The PS button brings up the console screen, but no scrolling is possible and it takes control away from any other guitar connected. If you can actually get it into gameplay, the symptoms are similar to those experienced with other Guitar Hero games (no star power deployment using tilt, etc.). DON'T BUY THIS if you want to play Guitar Hero on PS3; suck it up and get the new wireless guitar(s) made for the system.\n",

For instance, in chapter 7, the author keeps referring to the web.config file as \"config.web\". Additionally, I've already come across several other major errors in the code examples, more than found in the online errata section. I guess listing them all would be too embarrassing!Sure, the book is an easy read. It's an easy read because it's neither in-depth, nor detailed. Often, a lot of concepts in the code examples are never explained properly.Using ASP.NET??? If you use this book, the errors and the lack of in-depth coverage will leave you dazed, you will end up with more questions than answers, and you will soon be looking for a better book to help you learn ASP.NET in earnest.\n",
      "__label__2 A nice package all around: This is really a very nice collection of love songs from Elvis. I wish the tracking order had been in chronoligcal order by year, but otherwise I'm very happy with the collection. I purchased it for the unreleased studio version of \"For The Good Times\" which is nice, but in my opinion does not come close to the live version on the Madison Square Garden album. For those that are new to Elvis thanks to the #1 hits and 2nd To None collections this will be a great way to hear a little of the different styles of music Elvis was capable of. I do have to say that \"Unchained Melody\" is a stand out on here as every Elvis fan knows that this was close to the end for him, but the voice was stronger than ever. Sure Elvis fans will have these songs in their collections already, but the remastering job by Vic Anesini is stellar and it brings new life to these classics and will not disappoint.\n",

Wonderfully written, with unforgettable profiles of major historical and literary figures. \"Laughter is Forbidden!\" announced the Germans as they produced Shakespeare's plays -- but laughter, tears, and insights are the inevitable outcome of a few hours curled up with \"Anglomania: A European Love Affair.\"\n",

I cannot really remember the film very well, because I was too busy clowning around at the back of the room with a few classmates in order to avoid having to watch it. It just did not capture my interest. Years later, I went online and read about the summary of the book and concluded that I really had not missed out on something that I would regret having missed out on, since it's just another little-guy-against-big-corporation story. I am very sorry if I've offended anybody with my critique of this film, because it is fine with me if you love it; I just did not. Also, I apologize to the makers of this film if I have insulted them, and also to the author who wrote \"Hoot\" if this review has or would offend him.

Typical Hollywood - put down the father figure at every opportunity.\n",

It is very impact resistant to the point of being almost indestructible. Once I accidentally hit a support beam/pillar with full force (don't ask -_-) and I found no trace of damage on the bokken. The only flaw I see is that polypropylene is not as dense as wood so the bokken is easily damaged by sharp objects and can be cut by bladed weapons. This is not really an issue unless you decide to channel musashi and fight a katana with a bokken.\n",

      "__label__2 The Stickers Rock!: At 2 1/4 cents for each sticker this book is the bargain of all time! The sticker slogans are super cool and the quality is as good as individually sold stickers, so my recommendation is to load up on this book - you'll never buy stickers this cheap again.\n",
      "__label__1 Not so sticky: The stickers have many great sayings, but they're not as sticky as ones I've bought at record shops and other places. In a collage of stickers gathered from many places, these were the only ones to peel up on their own (within two days).\n",

The description above clearly says the sticker are vinyl. They are not and seem to be paper. Either way they barely stick to anything I put them on if at all and are easily damaged when wet. Sure its a book of cheap stickers but I was really hoping they would last on my car more than a trip to the store before falling off. I suppose if you're looking to sloganize your workspace or public places then go ahead and get the book. If you're looking for quality stickers spend a few bucks on select slogans and go for quality.\n",

Not for me.\n",

They simply did not seemed to care about it anymore.Page 285 - The only information about Samba is a half page print out of the homepagePage 286 - 287 : unnecessary lengthy /etc/hosts file are printed 3 times. Page 282 : half page printout of homepageRight from the beginning, the book is crammed with serious mistakes.My estimate is that if the authors try hard for about 2 years, they will start to understand linux. Then they will have to spend another 5-7 years to become good in it. Only after that should they even think about teaching linux.\n",

What else do you expect from someone whose only experience is clicking some silly microsoft buttons. Shame on you authors.It makes me so angry that some cheap MS guy managed to get guy 40$ from me for this useless book.By the way a zombie process is a process which is already dead ( and hence the name zombie ) , but whose parent is still alive, but has not yet asked for the process termination status. ( So the OS still keeps parts of the dead process' process table thinking that some time later the parent is going to ask for the status - wait system call. This results in the wastage of system resources ).\n",

      "__label__2 Great modern Christmas album: I always reach for this album when I want to listen to something Christmas-y, but am sick of all the traditional songs. This album has a nice mix of new Christmas songs and new takes on old ones. I particularly like the ones by Harry Connick, Jr. and Dido. I scoffed at it when my husband brought it home, but once I listened to it, I loved it. Actually, I'm listening to it write now and it inspired me to buy a few albums by some of the artists.\n",

Her ideas on the afterlife in the books are very thought provoking. For anyone who likes vampires, werewolves, etc this is a must read!\n",
      "__label__2 looking for the rest of the book: Broken was a bit of a disappointment. It is a quick read and not a bad book, but I was looking for a little bit more. There are a number of storylines that are introduced throughout the book, but none of them really mature. It left me wanting more, which isn't a problem that I normally have with Ms. Armstrong's books. Even the main storyline, with the portal unleashing a Jack the Ripper-like killer seemed shallow. There is little Pack interaction. The witches are only mentioned. Jamie pops in with a narrative hook, that goes nowhere. The newest vampire seems to be more comic relief than much else.As I'm reading, it occurred to me that the book, just well, seemed tired and other readershave commented that this is the last \"Elena\" book. Evidently, I'm not the only one thinking \"tired\" since there is a teaser for a new series by Armstrong in the back that looks interesting and different. It is about a woman \"completely of this world,\" according to the teaser.\n",
      "__label__1 A mature, immature book: I guess I am the minority with my review. I thought this book was a yawn. Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler's angsty prose. I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point. I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour). I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.All in all, the material is meant for 'mature' readers, but the style is clearly not. A lot of reviewers say that the 'love' between the main character and her brother is just 'beautiful', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings. In my opinion, this book is purely shock value with no substance, so if that is your thing, then go for it.\n",

      "__label__2 Goes with everything: I bought this cardigan because it looked a little more dressy and I liked the way it looked paired with the tank (which I also bought in mauve). I was surprised whtne the cardigan went with everything. It is longer than I expected, so it goes well with the tunics that were in style this fall/winter. I also love the detailing of the sleeves, and the little pockets. The material is soft, and has the slightest sheen to it - I can't imagine it becomeing fuzzy or dull anytime soon. What I love most about the cardigan is that it is very versitile - so far I've worn it with tanks and turtlenecks, every color imaginable (I bought it in white). The versatility also means it can go with dressy, business and casual wear - and I've worn all three. It has become a staple in my wardrobe.\n",

      "__label__2 Emotionally satisfying and endearing: Patrick Gale has written yet another fine book full of believable characters and unpredictable plots. I have read all of his books and found them to be consistently well written, entertaining, and thought-provoking. This book delves into the infinite complexities of human relationships but does not become ponderous. His sudden and eccentric plot twists keep the reader stimulated and guessing. This book may seem dark at first, but don't give up - there is a rare treat in store. I have eagerly awaited Patrick Gale's each new offering for the last 10 years and have yet to be disappointed.\n",

It is even better on DVD . . . it's widescreen and you get to see so much more.\n",
      "__label__1 Unsubstantiated Account: This book has no basis for the items presented as facts. Obviously, not a song critic; the author shows no appreciation at all for the lyrics and verse that captured, and still captures the world. The accounts of John Denver's personality were also written as fact instead of the farce that it is. Members of his family, children and ex-wives; continue to praise on camera-his gentleness and giving. This is not the book to read if you want insight into a man who gave the world his genius and his hope for a better world in the only way he knew to share this hope. He was, however, a man and problems he had with alcohol and relationships are outlined in his autobiography...and not very different from the evils many people face from day to day.\n",
      "__label__1 All About Collis: I was vastly disappointed in this book. It would only rate a C as a freshman term paper. Collis mostly writes his gut level reaction to Denver's songs and the cultural events of the fifties through nineties with absolutely no attempt to analyze or substantiate. Why on a book about Denver do we have a page and a half about Rosa Parks? Was Denver there with her on the bus? One would find more content on Denver's life in a People Magazine article.\n",

The book is an easy read that doesn't get weighed down in first principles. This means that you can quickly get the information you require and have confidence in your decisions. It's a must for anyone working in the industry, especially those who may be offshore, I always have my copy with me.\n",
      "__label__2 Above Average Military Sci-Fi: Ditto. This book, and the previous one (Semper Mars) both provide solid summer escape reading. Unlike Sherman & Cragg's \"Starfist\" or Diehl's \"Legion of the Damned\" series, Douglas's characters are actually believable.For those of you who like Douglas's (ie. Bill Keith's) work, I also recommend his \"Seals: The Warrior Breed\" series, written under another pseudonym, H. Jay Riker.

      "__label__1 Poor quality: While the \"easy pour\" feature is nice, the plastic itself is very poor quality. It makes the milk smell plasticy, is fragile and leaks. Also, the area you write on is in the same place the milk is so it makes it hard to write and you also run the risk of puncturing the bag unless you use a permanent marker or something similar. In my opinion, the nice easy pour feature isn't worth wasting the money on the bags. I reccommend Lansinoh brand bags!\n",

She didn't like this kit because of the size of the paintings.The actual paintings are about 5x7 card size. They are REALLY small. There is no way they can expect you to paint this in a tiny dot so small.It is more advanced (in my opinion) in that you are supposed to use their drawing as guidelines and paint over it how you want.

I thought rosamunde didnt really realize how rude she was and poor izzy had to go through her. i would have told her to shutup to listen to me. I think that Marco should have been punished. Marco should have been put into jail or his driver's license should have been taken away. I think Rosamunde should have been nicer.

She got really depressed because she was in a stuffy hospital and her room was just plain it wasn't different. Which she liked being different from everybody else. When she got to go home she found out she had to get a fake leg. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes books that go slow, and are boring.

      "__label__1 What was the point of this book???: I had to read this book for summer reading and found that it was really BAD. Izzy went on a date with a senior who she didn't really like and then went home with him even though he was drunk. She got in an accident and lost her leg. Abandoned by her \"friends\" she befriended an \"odd\" girl named Rosamunde who she'd never really liked before. Izzy was too absorbed in being liked and \"nice\" and I didn't understand why she would't take a ride home with the guy she had a crush on when he offered. I thought that the Izzy in her head that did cartwheels that she was always mentioning made no sense. I found the parts where Izzy was in the hospital really boring, and her parents bugged me. Instead of being happy that she'd made a friend who visited her and kept her happy, her mom was worried that Rosamunde wasn't Izzy's type. The story had no heart... it didn't make me like the characters, it didn't make me happy, it didn't make me sad, it was just boring.\n",
      "__label__2 Izzy Willy-Nilly: This book was a very well written book. The story about Izzy was very realistic. This is a good story for teenagers to read about drinking and driving and about how it can ruin your life. To go to a life that is perfect to \"not so perfect\" is very hard to deal with. I would recommend all this book to all teenagers.\n",

Reducing wounds to five and then pinning body types on certain wounds with certain recipies for healing was just too reduced for my taste.

      "__label__2 Excellent for Lyrics But Lacking In Music Information: This is an amazing book as far as teaching you one of the fundamental aspects of song writing goes, which is giving the song proper STRUCTURE. It teaches song structure from strictly a lyricist's point of view however, such as verse/chorus structures or verse/bridge etc. The book is worth its weight in gold for this info alone. But it lacks ANY information on how to write the music for the song. But nevertheless, it has some greeaattt ideas. Buy it for its really cool ideas on how to write song lyrics (but don't look for music composition in it.) One of the great ideas it has, though, is to write lyrics while listening to one of your favorite song's music. Conversely, you could write the music for your song's lyrics, by arranging your music to one of your favorite song's lyrics. Do you see what I'm saying. This really really works to give you an awesome song structure!\n",
      "__label__1 Shattered handle in a sealed box!: Stopped at Macy's to take a look at this. The sales clerk opened a sealed box to reveal a SHATTERED handle. Buyer beware. Seems awful.Compared to other pressure cookers, the design of the large handle on this one seems to be inherently easy to break.Also note that a 6-quart cooker is too small for most uses. Remember, you can only fill half-way with soup, and a piece of meat cannot extend higher than 3/4 the height of the cooker. Check out the Presto 8 quart that costs about 25% less and includes excellent customer service. Just my 2 cents!\n",

Called Fagor and they acted as if this had never happened before, even though multiple other one star evaluations mention the same problem. The item was unusable and I sent it back and got a refund.

The replacement Duo has had lid-locking trouble as well, followed by, when 3 months' new, the screw holding the handle onto the pot continually getting loose but becoming stripped so that the pot/handle cannot be repaired. With my repeated calls and emails to Fagor customer service to get the pot repaired or replaced, I was discouraged by their slow and impersonal response; if they replied at all, it was with a cryptic one-line instruction and web-link to watch their long and complicated video on how to repair the pot myself!

      "__label__1 Could have been better: Whilst I concede the Mr Leckie's prose style is easily-paced and therefore Hannibal is the kind of book you could probably read in a single afternoon, all this book really achieves is to prove you cannot write a fictional biography of one of history's most captivating figures in a mere 241 pages. I had high hopes because a full third of those pages dealt with Hannibal's boyhood where the author is at full license to use his imagination given the lack of historical detail for Hannibal. But it almost as though Mr Leckie gets bored and rushes through the end in order to begin writing Scipio. Historical inaccuracies aside, the life of Hannibal deserves a better account than the author has attempted and I think it is safe to say that the definitive fictional biography of Hannibal has yet to be written. If you like historical fiction set in the Roman period buy it, if not, don't.\n",

The author mentions on pg 42 that due to space constraints he will list only one lang or the other.

Listing 4.1 gives code to be added to the page_load method. When you try to run it it doesn't work. You find out 3 pages later that you should have added a group of \"using\" statements. It would have been easy to add these lines to the snippet, or at least give a forward reference to them.In the same snippet you're invited to open a database named \"pubs\" (Publications) The following snippets perform various functions on this database.

Tech support talked me through about 6 troubleshooting steps over 3 calls and finally had me send it back. It took 2 weeks to get an RMA# and then only after I called them to say what's up. I sent it back and again two weeks before I called again and they sent one overnight. I guess they don't do anything unless you complain. This new one seems to work fine except I can't get it to successfully extend an encrypted network of any level encryption.

The final product is sweet and creamy, despite warnings that homemade yogurt cannot rival the texture and consistency of commercial yogurt. Not so in my case. This was a great buy that I'm very pleased with. Note that you'll need a candy thermometer or food thermometer that reads temperatures as low as 100 degrees and as high as 160 degrees.\n",

I heat NON-homogenized whole milk with powdered milk until warm and add 1/2 cup of commercial yogurt.

Will the yogurt look like or have the same type of consistency as store bought yogurt.....no. but it comes pretty close to it. I read some of the reviews saying that it does not make yogurt like you can buy in the store. To that I say \" you will be enjoying natural yogurt with more nutrition (probiotic). Store-bought yogurt actually defeats the whole purpose of eating yogurt with your meal. You can make store-bought like consistancy if you incorporate little bit of pectine or soluble fibre like agar agar powder. If you don't like the excess water in home made yogurt, it is better to strain the water out with a cheese cloth. In that case you don't have to add extra powder milk.\n",

There are other yogurt makers much cheaper. This item has been discontinued. Usually when a small kitchen appliance is discontinued it goes on clearance. It is important to note that this item does not churn ice cream, and it does not churn or freeze yogurt. This item merely heats to the proper temperature for making yogurt. The sellers who are selling this item are clearly unethical as anyone can see by the price. This is a yogurt maker and should be priced as such. Someone needs to get real and fix the price issue here. Amazon should not allow this sort of price gouging.\n",

The Salton yogurt maker is a no-frills, budget appliance; it is not one of those fancy, gourmet Euro-Cuisine or Donvier makers, which come with individual-sized glass jars and cost twice as much as the Salton. No, the Salton YM9 is a plastic, plug-in model, and it does the job FINE. I wanted to make my own yogurt because store-bought yogurt is costly, and, if you read most ingredient labels, is often made with high-fructose corn syrup. I prefer the 1-quart container because I make a big batch of plain yogurt once a week, and then add pureéd frozen fruit and Splenda to flavor it as I desire. It's a healthful breakfast food or snack.

The book started out where a tragedy is announced and I was immediately pulled into the novel and ready for some heartwrenching times.Instead, as the book progressed, I had trouble reading it becuase it seemed like he was just trying to hard or something.If you read Prayer for Owen Meany, then Son of the Circus, then you read this book, you are in for a big disappointment.\n",
      "__label__1 Please don't bother with this one: \"A Widow for One Year\" was my first John Irving book, and it might be my last. While I thought the plot was interesting (at first), it quickly went downhill from there. Irving cluttered up the novel with extempraneous details and subplots that did nothing to help me to the end. If anything, they were deterrents along the way. I didn't love, or even like, any of the characters. And Hannah was a nightmareÑI found myself wondering why Ruth (or anyone) would ever be friends with her. It was such an effort to finish the book that I vow never to force myself to read such drivel again. The only thing that I looked forward to in this book was finishing it so I could start a new oneÑby a different author.But, I hear \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" is well worth the read. However, the next Irving book I pick up will be from the library, as I can't bear to spend more money on anything that has the slightest chance of being so mundane.\n",
      "__label__1 A widow for one year - a waste of one month: When people ask me whose books I enjoy reading, the name John Irving is always first off my lips. Ever since a friend in college recommended \"Garp,\" I have been hooked by his engaging style and fascinating stories. Until now. This book bored me to tears. I did not care in the least for Ruth Cole, the main focus of the book, or any of the other drab people we meet along this sad journey. If this is the only John Irving book you have read and you didn't like it - don't do yourself a disservice - please buy and savor his previous fine novels. I will be first in line for his next tome, but as for this one, it is a sad disappointment. Sorry, John.\n",
      "__label__2 \"New\" Irving Fan: Having just read two of John Irvings books,(Cider House Rules) I am new to the phenomenon of Mr. Irving. However, I must agree with his most ardent fans, he is a wonderful storyteller. A novel that will totally submege you into the world of its characters. Even the \"weakest\" character is so well developed that you love him more for his weaknesses. Also my edition had an interview with the author at the end of the book. It was so enlightening. Read it only after you finish... I have now decided that my next two Irving books will be Garp and Prayer for Owen Meaney. Both these novels have been tranformed to the \"big Screen\". Having seen Cider House on the big screen, I saw all that was missing. I am looking forward to reading these two and rediscovering the world according to Irving.\n",
      "__label__1 I knew it wouldn't be Owen Meany and was STILL disappointed: John Irving seemed to be presenting his story of Ruth Cole as if from a great distance. His narrative seemed often to be building up to something - as if it were all deep background -- that never happened. Astounding coincidences aside, the narrative was so sparse, so clinical (and pretty crude)that it was really difficult to relate to any of the characters. For example, it was hard to imagine why Ruth Cole and Hannah were \"best friends\" as they acted like they only hurt and annoyed each other. They didn't seem to understand or to comfort each other. It was as if Irving said they were best friends, so they were, but there was no reason to believe. I did like the narrative devices that Irving used, including Ruth's postcards and journals as a chapter, and one of her short stories. It enriched what was otherwise a sparse narrative. In all, the first section was the most compelling, the rest... not so much.\n",
      "__label__1 Dull and lifeless after the first 100 pages: Mr. Irving starts off strong, with interesting well drawn characters. However, after the first section, there is nothing that's either interesting, compelling or particularly well written. It's my guess that Mr. Irving started a pretty good novel and either to explain or excuse his purient interest in prostitutes, tried to steer his good opening into a trite story about and unlikeable writer and her purient interest in prostitutes. I guess if nothing else, this book helped Mr. Irving explain to his wife and the IRS why he needed to hang out in Amsterdam's red light district.\n",
      "__label__2 Irvings best ever!: John Irving continually amazes me. As in all his books, I was not bored for one page. No one can create characters the way Irving can. His best ever!\n",
      "__label__1 this was the same writer who gave us GARP?: I can't believe it... GARP was such a masterpiece, and this was such drivel. Disappointing!\n",
      "__label__1 The scenarios seemed contrived, uninteresting characters.: As this was my first Irving book, and I had heard such great things about his writing, I expected to sit back and be thoroughly entertained. No such luck. I was relatively bored by Ruth as a main character. Her raucus friend Hannah seemed more interesting. And- big deal about the older woman, 16 yr. old boy story. Shocking? Not really. If the story was about Eddie's life after this love affair, it would have been much more colorful. Not much room in this book for titilation either, lest a murder get in the way. Yawn. Drawbacks: boring, and slightly interesting from chapter to chapter Positives: At least there was some resolution of conflicts- or hint at it. Loved the ending. Clever final dialogue.\n",
      "__label__1 Such a disappointment: It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote the extraordinary Cider House Rules. It felt to me like one long (in Irving fashion) rebuttal letter to his critics. This book was transparently Irving's forum for justifying, through character Ruth, his style and choices in past works. If you read the book, you'll understand. Yes, I believe a man can write from a woman's viewpoint. No, I don't believe Irving was able to pull it off in Widow. The book read like a Sidney Sheldon novel. The only difference is that (so far) it's not embarrassing to read a John Irving book on the bus. The story was entirely predictable, the writing simplistic and even dumbed-down and the cliches ran rampant. I was expecting something more heady from one of my favorite American authors.\n",
      "__label__1 Not My Type: I picked up this book based on numerous good reviews on the internet, plus, john irving is a renowned writer. However, I couldn't bring myself to continue reading past page 20. The characters are a bit too weird for me. I believe this is my first & last john irving's book.\n",

I am afraid the creator of my all time favorite character has let me down. Next time I buy paperback and read the reviews.\n",

Trust me; there will be a bonfire when we talk about this book. How can someone write that many pages about breasts and cashmere sweaters and how jeans fit? Come on! There's much more to life and people than that. The characters had no depth, no souls, and I had no desire to know them as people. At a cocktail party, if I'd met someone like ANY of them, I would have moved on. I prefer REAL books.\n",

      "__label__1 A sad excuse for a study guide: This book is the worst study guide I have ever purchased. For that matter, it is the worst book I have ever purchased for a number of reasons. First, the book is full of typographical errors, improperly spaced sentences and poor grammar. Second, the book is printed on cheap paper and poor quality ink. The book reminds me of an old dimestore novel with the \"cheap grungy feel to it\". Third, the quality of the review material is horrible and is presented in an almost unreadable manner.I aced the Praxis 2 test this book was supposed to help with and did not see any benefit from reading or purchasing this book.

      "__label__1 No quality control: When I received the boat for christmas we were very excited. Mom had even thought to get an extra battery. Unfortunately when the seal was broken and the contents reviewed it was found that there was no antennae for the remote control. The slot was empty where it belonged. There were no instructions- none- and the decals were all crushed up in one corner of the box. Just for the heck of it I tried to see if it would work without an antennae but it was dead as a doornail without it. Amazon accepted it back- only option allowed was to return for refund. However may be stuck with the extra battery. What a disappointment. Very poor quality control. The boat was very cheaply made and the hinge to open the battery door felt very flimsy and had to be pried open. I certainly will not but from these people again.

He did not crash it once and it zoomed around in our pond giving several hours of fun during the week we had it in the summer. However it stopped working on the 7th day (was it observing the Sabbath?) and despite replacing the battery pack it just would not work again. I tried contacting the company and asking for a replacement or a refund but they ignored me. I would not buy this boat again or deal with this company. A big fat waste of $40.\n",

There were some major delays with the book's arrival, but that's another matter.The writing is of poor quality. The book's production values seem to be not quite up to par. The fact that so much of the book was based on the Lueken work was the most shocking part of it all. The supply list in the back of the book smacked of hucksterism.I, too, am sorry I bought this book, and urge those who are interested in this sort of material to look elsewhere, starting with Father Malachi Martin's books.

Even the vocabulary felt simplified. This does not make this a bad book, merely one that I could not recommend to anyone with any understanding of the period, or who wanted a more fully developed love story. It might be a good book to use to introduce your daughter or granddaughter to Historical Romance novels (but I'd prefer something there with more life to it and better characters). The sex scenes are tepid, the characters are one-dimensional, and there is a lot of internal prayer and moralising, if you like that sort of thing.\n",

      "__label__2 Steve Earle in 2000: Tracks included on Steve Earle's live from Austin, TX in 2000 are as follows: 1. Transcendental Blues, 2. Everyone's In Love With You, 3. Another Town, 4. Taneytown, 5. Hard-Core Troubadour, 6. Someday, 7. Telephone Road, 8. The Devil's Right Hand, 9. More Than I Can Do, 10. I Can Wait, 11. Goodbye, 12. Steve's Last Ramble, 13. Copperhead Road, 14. The Unrepentant, and 15. Christmas In Washington. This 2000 concert presents a striking contrast from Steve Earl's performance in 1986 at the same venue during his \"clean cut\" days. Steve has grown tremendously over the years as both a singer and a song writer. Damn... Steve on mandolin on Copperhead Road is priceless. Love Copperhead Road! This is a must have DVD for Steve Earle fans, and if you happen to have his 1986 performance you will come close to having complete concert footage spanning most of his career. The sound quality and video are satisfactory.\n",
      "__label__2 Helps Maintain Existing Strength: I've been going to the gym for about 5 years pretty consistently now. I try to get there at least 3 times a week, but during the busy holiday months that doesn't always happen. I normally use muscle milk, but decided to give this a try after seeing it. While I didn't really notice too much increase of energy nor gains while using this, I was able to keep my muscle mass and the amount of weight I am pushing at the gym consistent even when only going once or twice a month so I think it works pretty well. So maybe if you use this every day and lift almost every day you would see better gains, but I really just wanted to maintain and it helped me with that so I would use it again.\n",
      "__label__2 Just the best: We shopped around on the internet and decided to go with the T-Fal Fit 'N Clean for these reasons: it has an upper and lower heating element, variable temp control, and you can put the whole unit in the dishwasher.

      "__label__1 Immature, unlikeable main character.: I was excited to read this book because the title indicated that it could be a compelling book. Instead, it was so boiler plate that I knew from almost the outset who was responsible and it was a chore to have to read through it just to find out what I already knew. Also, the characters were just dull or in the case of Meagan, annoying. The entire plot of her involvement in questioning a suspect was unbelievable. Actually, the entire book could have been a high school writing project.\n",
      "__label__1 Somewhat disappointed: After reading the great reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. But I was disappointed. The author's prose was excellent, and the story well conceived. But the only compelling character happens to be the victim, Dr. Diana Duprey, whose story is told through flashbacks. She is a multi-layered and very interesting character. Her husband Frank is bland, and her daughter Megan is a spoiled brat. I wanted to reach out and choke her halfway through the book. The \"romance,\" if you can call it that, between Megan and the detective seemed unnecessary and not believable. I also saw the ending coming a mile away. I kept waiting for a twist at the end, but it didn't come.\n",
      "__label__1 Somewhat Helpful but Disappointing: One of the best things about the book was it mentioning to do the NCAA 101. Unfortunately, you cannot do that in the game! Having the information available about the schools (over half of the book) and their favorite plays was helpful. So was the descriptions of the plays. However, the play images did not include player movement, which is crucial -- there is no excuse to \"save space\" for such crucial information -- one of the big reasons for such books is to be able to carry it and not have to have the game in front of you. The instructions and strategy are good, but not great. Helpful but disappointing.\n",

      "__label__2 If you like rice cakes, these are a great choice: Let's face it, there are 2 types of people in this world: those who like rice cakes & those who don't. I like these because they are vegan, not too salty, & crunchy (although they do make crumbs quite easily). So much easier to buy these in bulk. Popcorn flavor is light, but it does have more flavor than the plain ones.\n",
      "__label__2 Zippo Lighter Fluid: Zippo fluid burns much cleaner than most others, so its far easier to keep my lighter clean. Of course there is a bit of odor to the fluid, but I personally like it (yeah yeah.. don't say it). I've seen some of these cans leak at the cap when tilted, but mine doesn't. Its simple enough to grab and pour fluid into a Zippo, even being the large 12oz can.I'm not saying anything that others already haven't, so I'll end with this. If you want your Zippo to stay reasonably clean, not stink horribly, and burn consistently... get the Zippo brand. Other brands will work, just not as well.\n",

I've been told by zippo enthusiasts that you can use different fuels in your zippo, but this will always be popular because it has the zippo logo on it. The fuel itself smells exactly like lighter fluid that you put on your grill and comes in a metal canister.*NOTE* When I first got this, I pried the nozzle up and it flung zippo fluid in my EYE. Be careful when opening the container. Also, it comes out very fast and if you're not careful will leak onto things.\n",

I just want to say how wonderfully interesting this book was: I wasn't able to put it down.I didn't loathe any characters (strange for me) and had fallen in love with several of them by the end of the story. This book will not waste your time like so many others do: you will go back and reread it over and over again, just as I have.\n",
      "__label__1 Am I missing something?: After reading all the glowing reviews for this game, I cannot believe how incredibly dull and tedious it was. I gave up in the middle of the third case. The only reason I got that far was that I assumed I was missing something, that surely it must get better. I did not find this game to be challenging at all, it's a matter of reading through page after page of text, clicking on everything in a room to get all the evidence, and presenting everything you've got in court. I see no comparison between this and games where you actually have to solve puzzles, like Myst or the Nancy Drew games.\n",
      "__label__2 Nontraditional, but entertaining.: This is, simply put, not a game for everyone. This isn't a 'shoot em up', or action adventure. You play the role of, duh, Phoenix Wright, a young attorney just starting out. You gather evidence, follow the leads, and question witnesses on the stand, trapping them in their own lies.If you're the type who loves looking for all the details, twisted wordplay, and loves a good puzzle, this is your game. If all you're looking for is mindless violence, feel free to pass.\n",
      "__label__1 Poor Film Making at Its Finest: Bloody awful. Character actions lack motivation, logic, or explanation. Acting is brilliantly mediocre. Dialogue, what little there is between flashbacks and dream sequences, lacks punch and believability. Plot--if it can be called that--is tedious. Scenes drag on and on. It's pretty much a given that gay cinema sucks; this film does nothing to dispel that notion. I thought the directors' other film, \"Shank,\" was dreadful, but this...wow...even worse.\n",

The CD has nothing to do with the used car business; it is a recording of a telephone interview which discusses motivational techniques for all business. The title is less than honest but is only slightly justified by the instruction to go to a certain website for more about the used car business, but that information is kindergarten level stuff which can be obtained free on most any online search engine. If you need motivation buy good motivational books available most anywhere and if you need help in used car sales this will not help you.\n",

It was long, yet entertaining...every minute. It is the ONLY Game is the 5 years of playing games (computer & Playstation) that I will play again. As a horror fan, I loved Fatal Frame and Silent Hill and fancied Resident Evil...But now this game tops every game Ive ever played. Scary...exciting...Interesting. Controls were cool too. In the past I had a hard time with Resident evil controls; eventually catching on. I look forward to Resident evil 5, and I heard it is only going to be released on x-box 360. I may be wrong...but if it is, Im buying an x-box 360!\n",

The quality of the board book isn't great and the content is even worse. There are definitely better books out there for children, but I thought I'd give it a try because the price was right. I won't bother returning it, but I wouldn't recommend it.\n",

      "__label__1 Potty Book for 2-1/2 year old son: I bought this book for my son to read while potty training, he enjoys it but it is extremely vague in the actual process of what goes into the potty training process. For example it skips from Ernie got a new potty to when Ernie \"has to go\" he sits on the potty and \"goes\". I pretty much don't even read the words but rather am descriptive for my son, I will read it \"when Ernie has to pee-pee or poopie\". I would not recommend this as a real learning experience for your child, but as I said my son does enjoy looking at it.\n",

We had this book for 2 weeks before the pages got bent in half.Second, I didnt like the fact that ernie used WAY to much toilet paper. The day after we read this book I found my bathroom covered in toilet paper. Yeah the probably would have done that anyway, but the book didnt help the situiation.

      "__label__2 SPECIAL: NOW, NOW, NOW! In this age of hi-tech and instant gratification it is not proper to restore [retouch] everything to pristine quality [imagine tampering with the Mona Lisa because it looks too drab!]. Sure this DVD has flaws [the horrid Anglo dubbing should go - keep the original French and give us subtitles]. However, this is pure nostalgia, the flavor and essence of Piaf and her amours [the breathtaking Marcel, cut in his prime] - then Theo.Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker, Jean Marais, Cocteau, Romy Schneider, Alain Delon, Jean Paul Belmondo, etc. we get glimpses of the not so distant past - this is a perfect mood piece, instead of an 'in your face' documentary.A must have for the serious collector.\n",
      "__label__1 For devoted fans only: This DVD should be viewed by devoted fans only and preferably French speaking fans at that. The picture quality is extremely poor, the appearances of Piaf are cobbled together and the sound is atrocius. It's dedinitely not one for the average viewer!\n",
      "__label__1 Big dissappointment: Essentially, the problem for me was that the dubbing was done so obtrusively and so poorly that it becomes painfully embarrassing to watch this DVD in English (which is the only option.)Subtitles would have done the trick nicely, enabling us to hear the people onscreen yet understand them. When Piaf talks, her voice is immediately paved over by the voice of non-actor reading a translation of Piaf's words.Beyond that, it seemed a bit ragtag as a documentary -- some interesting details, but it all feels rather like an inexpensively made TV special that makes do with whatever odds and ends are most readily available.\n",

It will let me look at the pictures I took three months ago, but nothing else... it instantly shuts right back off.Better yet, after an hour of internet research, apparently several people have had this problem... so I dug out my old SONY camera. It took two good pictures and then the picture/video card fried! It literally started trembling in my hand.I'm done with Sony... last month our two year old Sony DVD player died too.

He's a game warden trainee who becomes involved in a murder when a local outfitter's body appears in his woodpile. The plot concerning greedy business interests versus a thought-to-be-extinct mammal in Wyoming's beautiful wilderness is familiar, but the characterizations are great. Joe is a courageous yet flawed hero; his wife, Marybeth, is loving yet headstrong. What happens to the characters in this novel is reflected in their emotional growth over the next books in the series and often has devastating consequences. A great read.\n",

In this case, the title is totally misleading.With respect to length, the book drones on and on, and took me a surprisingly long time to finish considering the modest number of pages.With respect to being an introduction, the author seems more interested in showing his expertise rather than guiding those new to the subject. He spends a lot of time on esoterica, while failing to clearly present the basics of linguistics.For a truly good introduction, I suggest \"Teach Yourself Linguistics\" by Aitchison, which is well organized, concise, and covers all of the basics.

Rock Swings was an amazing record with an unexpected selection of tunes, and nearly every one of them meticulously treated to a terrific swing interpretation. I was hoping for another helping, but alas my strong suspicion is that this album is the tracks that didn't make it on Rock Swings. The only one that could have made it that first album is the first track \"Time After Time,\" and after that it all goes tragically down hill.\n",
      "__label__1 Come on Paul. You are a Legend. You can do better.: I am a huge fan of Paul Anka and he surely has created some of the best songs of the last century. HOWEVER this album is soo boring. It could put me to sleep were it not so pretentious. Anka's got the voice and the songs could have been well covered, but the jazzy style he gives to songs such as Against the WInd or Ordinary World is just intolerable.Sorry Mr. Anka. Better luck next time.\n",
      "__label__1 Piece of Junk: The product arrived damaged, not from shipping damage, but from packing at the factory. Too damaged to use. Dealer said they didn't want it back. It's a good thing, because it was replaced by a unit that wouldn't run. I took the fan unit (which wan't damaged) out of the damaged unit and put it in the second unit and it runs, but only at a low fan speed. Anything higher causes too much vibration noise. Also, both units we received were poorly finished, with the base being several shades lighter than the cover, which matches the picture on the box. It looks like they only gave the bottom one coat of stain. Thanks to the dealer who refunded our money. My email with complaints directly to the manufacturer got no response.\n",
      "__label__1 Had some problems: We had this humidifier for 21 days before it quit working. Before that it worked great, the humidity in our home was more comfortable. However, Amazon made it no problem and sent us a new one in about 4 days. We'll see how this one last. Amazon was great in dealing with them.\n",
      "__label__1 Essick Humidifier - Poor Quality: As several other reviewers discovered, this product (Essick Air 696-400 humidifier) is lacking in quality. The cabinet is flimsy, the unit is noisy, and the wick is a disaster! Poor engineering from the word GO.The variable speed control causes the motor to hum loudly when used at lower speeds. This hum is amplified by the thin, light-weight, plastic cabinet. When the motor is turned up to higher speeds the fan creates an unacceptable level of noise.The first time I cleaned the wick, following the directions in the owners care & use manual, the paper element began collapsing and would have completely fallen out had I not caught it in time.I seriously regret spending so much money on such an inferior product!\n",
      "__label__2 Funny-looking Substitute for the Real Thing: This is a fun-loving item for those that miss having the real bird where they might be residing at the present time(e.g.- vacationing for a long time)!\n",
      "__label__1 Very noisy, at least the unit I received: I guess there must be something wrong with the unit I received, since pretty much everyone else gave this a good review.For me this box had an extremely high noise floor. Actually, it created the same hiss even when I turned Drive and Gain all the way down. So I sent it back.I am one of very few people who report this problem about the TubePre, which is why I suspect that there might be a small number of defective boxes out there.Too bad, it looked good on paper, I liked the VU display and had been looking forward to experimenting with different tubes.I ordered the VTB-1 instead, I hope that is going to work for me.\n",
      "__label__2 Great Product (but arduous to clean): We bought this product, as part of our Dr. Weil '8 Weeks to Optimum Health' regimen. And, we really love it. During the winter, when the bedroom gets so dry, the humidifier really does the trick. And, it may be in our heads, but the air really does seem to be cleaner than in the rest of the house.This product has great air quality ratings (HEPA, etc.) relative to other products in its price range, and was easy to set up, etc.Our only gripe is that it is a bit of a pain to clean. You need to take it all apart, etc. However, this may be the case with all of these products, and thus, may just be par for the course.We recommend this product whole-heartedly.\n",
      "__label__2 Lightly Scented and so gentle: My Tibetan Terrier is sixteen and she has allergies, including respiratory ones. She is also allergic to oatmeal in shampoos; none in this one. I have to bathe her frequently to remove pollen and dust. The scent is light and doesn't make her sneeze or cough, and it doesn't irritate her eyes. It would be better if it had no scent, but I am very happy with this product.\n",
      "__label__2 Great workout - production not so great: I am really enjoying this DVD, but very disappointed in the music production. There are too many empty gaps of no music at all while working out. You have to keep walking while waiting for someone to start the music up again. I find this really frustrating. Leslie's wonderful personality makes up for the lack of good production.\n",
      "__label__2 It's fun and works great: I'm 63 and love to walk but with the Montana winters I am limited. This DVD is even better than walking so come spring, I'll do both. I have already lost inches in the first month, although I have yet to lose weight. But I feel better and my backaches are less every day. In fact, I feel the difference when I don't do at least 1 mile in the morning before work.\n",
      "__label__2 deadman wonderland: i love it because it is a really good anime. I got it for my friend for christmas. she really love it to.\n",
      "__label__2 Great set and cover art but is not uncensored!: The product is great I enjoy watching this one. It is a little paranormal/science fiction/horror/fantasy/action/drama/romance/suspense. I love my dead man wonderland set. But it is not uncensored not completely. The introduction is not uncut and there are scenes that are not fully uncut. I should know I have seen some of the uncut episodes online. Overall 4 stars.\n",
      "__label__2 Nice book - Gets to the point fast. .. like the PDA section: This book explain the how-tos very clearly. I specially like the section on PDAs.Overall I found the book very useful.\n",
      "__label__2 Ginger Drink: a real discovery!: I tasted the Ginger Drink in the form of tea on a recent trip to visit a son and daughter-in-law in Ljubljana. It seemed very restorative and I was pleased to order some from the website he furnished and get it so quickly. If I happened to have an upset stomach or a cold, it would be even better. Very bracing!\n",
      "__label__2 A true treasure with a colorful look: Not only is this bear huggable, kissable and pretty; it is also a true treasure. Unique in its own way, with a different array of colors for each individual bear. Great for kids who are allergic to loose fur found on most plush toys. This bear has a material so soft, so smooth and has a great clean feeling. It is also a true collectible.\n",
      "__label__1 nother piece of junk: really disappointed by this product..to actually get the spray you have to really ramp up pressure so the plants are wiped out by the pressure..stupid set up..could a part be missing?\n",
      "__label__1 Great Camera, but storage isn't: Great camera. Great pictures. But -- the storage is terrible! A floppy disk can hold only so many images... AND it'll hold only ONE megapixel image. There are better soloutions out there. CompactFlash cards can hold 64MB of images, at the least. Iomega Clik! for Digital Cameras drives can hold 40MB of imagery. And, floppy disks are expensive. I highly reccomend this for novices, but for serious photographers, stay away!\n",
      "__label__2 Friendly, easy to use and convenient camera: If you are looking for a convenient, smart and easy to use camara. This is it, while resolution is not as good as other camaras, if you need it for web applications its good enough. One very good feature, at least for me, is its great macro capability and manual focus. You can take objects as close as 1 cm. You can also control the exposure level which for close distance shots is a very usefull feature. But the best feature for me is the fact that it stores in floppy disks. This is a convenient storage media and while the storage capacity is not big, they are so cheap you can buy as many as you need. Overall I'm very happy with it, I strongly recommend it.\n",
      "__label__1 sony service sucks: the camera itself has excellent features , the pictures are fair in conparison with other cameras priced hundreds less (olympus d-450 zoom and others) but the best feature is easy downloads that can be e-mailed directly out.\n",
      "__label__1 Much too light in color: Lovely bracelet if you like a clear look with a hint of color. The picture presented is clearly showing a light color of aquamarie. The bracelet received looks clear.\n",
      "__label__2 Fascinating: I would have to recommend this movie to people who enjoy atypical yet thought-provoking movies. It is different and not for people not willing to think outside the box. This is a movie about friendship, love, loss, sadness, and the general simplicities in life that are usually over looked. This movie was definitely sad and also made me happy. I enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie. There are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing. At most, I would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship. A genuine friendship that is rare today. You can do many fancy things to prove you are \"best friends,\" but does your friendship provide you a sense of hope and inspiration? \"You are my best friend. You are my only friend.\" One person can make a difference in a persons life, as Mary and Max had did for one another.\n",
      "__label__2 great deal: This is my second projector and first Viewsonic. It is small, compact, and delivers a great picture. Very pleased with my projector, much better than getting a wide screen tv.\n",
      "__label__1 Does not perform as stated and implied, and will smoke you out rather than leave you smokeless!: This item was an exciting idea, but it stopped there. After receiving 2 of these items, both were tried and very little, if any smoke made it to the filter, even when holding a cigarette within an 1/8 of an inch from the intake. Usage of this item even as only a simple ashtray is not possible as the holders are so small that any cigarette of normal size does not fit.The item is made of what is clearly the cheapest materials and it shows in the workmanship. The plastic housing, wiring, battery cap and filter are reminiscent of that cheap 1 or 2 dollar toy car with lights one finds and discount stores.The practical application of this \"smokeless\" ashtray will leave you smoked out, and frustrated, with only a waste of your time and money.\n",
      "__label__1 Seems that they have 2 mango varieties: A few months ago a friend turned me on to a bag of the Mariani Phillipine Mango & I had been hooked! I was excited when I saw that Amazon sold it in bulk, when the order arrived & I opened a bag, I was so disappointed. The variety Amazon carries is the \"Mariani Thailand Mango\" and the one I went crazy for was the \"Mariani Phillipine Mango\" there was a HUGE difference in taste & texture. Now I'll have to see who wants the 11 unopened bags I have :( At least I can buy the ones I like at my local Jewel Food Store.\n",

He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles.

      "__label__2 If you can't make it to Mongolia this season....: Mykel Board -- punk rocker, New Yorker, gonzo provocateur -- fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to Mongolia for one year to teach English...and I'm so glad he did. His easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny, from his problems overcoming constipation (because Metamucil is not sold in Outer Mongolia, Board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea), to his visits to Mongolian dance clubs, to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-Soviet limbo land (\"Welcome to Mongolia!\" is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention). Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom. Buy this book.\n",
      "__label__1 Banal and Boring: No, I'm not making this up. Somebody actually produced this recording. Actually, two people produced it. Nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it. (I say \"nearly,\" because most of the tracks were played by a trio, who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet.) I'm not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining: these folks certainly were not up to the task. The end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties. Unbelievable...\n",

Now the OST, beautiful work. A very dark and somber piece, very moody and atmospheric. Its not something you just listen to for fun, at least for me. Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild's work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film. Some tracks are very tranquil and moody, while others pound out beats and are very fast paced. All in all a 5/5 for the cd, a definate must have for any collection! Highly recommneded!\n",
      "__label__1 Do not buy this camera: Its a very nice camera don't get me wrong. However due to its compact design, the speaker is too close to the tape motor. During quiet and not so quiet areas, you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record. Canon confirmed this as a design flaw. The ZR45, 40 and 50 all do this.

      "__label__2 This is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the 1980's: This is probably Mel Gibson's first film. A film he's done while he was in his 20's. There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as \"The Road Warrior.\" And \"The Road Warrior\" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.\"Mad Max\" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the \"action hero\" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.\n",
      "__label__2 Great DVD packed with a ton of features!: I've seen Mad Max dozens of times, but after watching the new SE DVD it was like watching it again for the very first time! That is not an exaggeration. The new DVD offers the choice of the poorly dubbed US soundtrack or the original Australian soundtrack. Watch the original track! The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action. If you've seen this movie in the past and thought, 'It was OK' this new DVD will have you saying, 'It was great!'\n",

I never wanted to stop listening to this album, because their music is so spectacular. If you heard the first track, Laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer. It reminds me of the Beatles' eerie song \"Revolution 9\" from the \"White Album.\" I could've just imagined while listening to \"Baby Lulu\" and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds. This is the best album I've ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you're at work or home.

Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!\n",

At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer's masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn't disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet's Carmen and a small handful of others, I'm not a great opera fan but Schreker's output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.\n",

That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test.

      "__label__1 Awful!: I was misguided by the review ratings... in all honesty, this product is awful. It has a toxic smell to it, and the \"bunny ears\" cause more pain than pleasure. I don't recommend this product.\n",
      "__label__1 HATE IT!: I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!\n",
      "__label__2 Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum \"my first vibrator\" hahaha!It's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more \"lifted\" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!\n",
      "__label__2 After 6 years, this album is still awesome.: This album contains danceable techno and mellow techno (trancey/ambient). Unlike most albums, ALL of the songs on this album are great. You'll definitely get your money's worth from this album. And even though it's over 6 years old, the music still sounds brilliant. Like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. said, this album was several years ahead of its time.\n",
      "__label__1 I'm glad I didn't pay for it.: I received this as a Christmas gift from a friend who knows I like hot tea. ALL of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea. I avoid drinking caffein, which green tea contains, so I gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections. The chest is kind of cheap (paper glued over something, as described by another reviewer). It's pretty, but I don't expect it to hold up.\n",
      "__label__2 Great book!: This book gives a great look into the Jewish mindset of the early 1900s. A must read for any young Bible student.\n",
      "__label__2 Streisand:Live In Concert (2CD's) - Good: This is a good double CD packed with alot of favorites. I liked slot of her \"dialouges\" between songs (her words & messages are invaluble & timeless). Il Divo accompanies her on several songs, like \"Evergreen\" (I would have preferred her to sing that one alone), \"The Music of the Night\" , & \"Somewhere\" (not favorable with Il Divo)\n",
      "__label__1 Come on... You Have Gotta Be Kidding!: Ok, first of all I was looking for Lighthouse the Classic Pop/Rock Group. There was NOTHING to tell me that this album was a Gospel CD.OK, I can live with that...So I listen to my new Lighthouse (GOSPEL) CD. Let me tell you, I was NOT IMPRESSED! The engineering sucked, The Music was mmmmmmm... ok, I guess, and, the singing really had NO feeling or substance behind it!So if you are into Gospel, steer clean and, if you are looking for Lighthouse (the classic pop/rock group), THIS IS NOT IT!Latter...\n",
      "__label__1 misleading photo: There was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the Watchtower toys with 3 action figures. We thought that the 3 action figures were included - they were not. Also, do not be fooled by the \"too good to be true\" price. They charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store.Otherwise, the package arrived in a timely manner, was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier.\n",
      "__label__1 Waste of money: If you get to this review, please, please, do not spend your hard earned money on this toy, even at half price it is not worth it. I faced the same problems as everyone else, I'm forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box. A watse of money! Nuff Said!\n",
      "__label__1 What a waste!: After an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up. The legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open. This was a major disapointment. We returned it the next day in pieces.\n",
      "__label__1 Slick Looking - Components are older technology - Keyboard sucks!: Picked one of these up the other day, mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller. But that's all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 \"generations\" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS.\n",
      "__label__1 Confused: I downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter. The authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing American with London slang. Honestly, it was the dumbest book I've tried to read in a long time. At least download the sample first.\n",
      "__label__2 Great deliver of all products: Fast delivery of all products. We just received the Bunn coffee maker. This is the fourth Bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years. Great product. The book and the hair iron were gifts so we don't know how they were liked.\n",
      "__label__2 Romeo and Juliet, the tragic story: Romeo and Juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love, although their parents were terrible enemies. Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn't have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them.\n",
      "__label__1 Oh Romeo: Stupid teenagers. A boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in. And poor communication. Shakespeare got teenage romance down pat.\n",
      "__label__2 A good introduction to the tragedies.: Romeo and Juliet is a beautiful story, and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of Shakespeare. Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.\n",
      "__label__1 RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!: We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message. If it wasn't for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn't understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because Leonardo Di Caprio acted as Romeo in the video!\n",
      "__label__1 Good book -- but not this edition: This is an excellent book. But this edition is extremely poorly produced. There are far too many typos, and little information about the original publication of the book, for example. The layout is ugly. It's great the book is cheap, but I wish I had paid a little more for a nicer version.\n",
      "__label__1 How do films like this get made?: If this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen it certainly is in the running. I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That's it!\n",
      "__label__1 What the Heck ???: The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer's uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don't get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!\n",
      "__label__1 Cute, But a Little Cheap...: This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointed: I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!\n",

      "__label__2 Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointed!: Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? \"Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!\"I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!\n",
      "__label__1 A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson \"in his own words\" but were nothing more than fabrication.\n",
      "__label__1 MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,\"Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he's milked you for two books.. he's a good crook.\"The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual.\n",
      "__label__1 Lies, Lies, Lies: For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it.\n",

      "__label__2 I couldn't put it down: Nappily Ever After was a true page turner. I couldn't put it down. Venus was a down to earth character that I could relate too. You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable.\n",
      "__label__1 sadly predictable: If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.\n",
      "__label__1 Struggled Through!: I struggled through this book. The storyline was a bore! I was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended, but too was I disappointed. If you absolutely have to read this book, borrow it from someone or the library!\n",
      "__label__1 Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However \"Hope\" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would.\n",
      "__label__2 A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.\n",
      "__label__2 A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating.\n",
      "__label__2 One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing \"object\" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read\n",

This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call \"The Three V's.\" The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.\n",
      "__label__1 Buyer Beware!!: If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!\n",

However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration.\n",

I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The \"auto\" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do.\n",
      "__label__2 a childhood favorite: In \"The Greengage Summer\" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended.\n",

      "__label__2 Most Interesting Ending: This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the \"natural disaster\" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too\n",

Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players.

Now i'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago (\"limited\" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider \"fixing\", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would've given this item four stars.

Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as \"Discontinued\". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.\n",

      "__label__1 Design is flawed.: If you grind a lot of coffee, over time you will realize that the rotation of the grinders is in the same direction as you slide the cover to remove it. The result is, that you will have to physically hold the top to the base when you grind beans.After a little over four years, the motor of the older model of this unit burned out.I should have never gotten rid of my Krups grinder.\n",

It grinds the beans very unevenly - some large pieces and some very fine dust, even on the \"Percolator\" (coarsest) setting.

I bought this coffee grinder and used it daily for a few months, when it started working only some of the time. Some days it would work righty off the bat, and other days it had to be disassembled and cleaned and reassembled, usually 2 or 3 times... unplugging it every time for safety. This added annoying minutes to the process of getting the first cup of coffee in the morning. It got to be so annoying that I put the grinder away in the cabinet and bought a bag of pre-ground coffee. When that ran out, the coffee grinder came out of the cabinet again, and this time it didn't work regardless of how many times it was cleaned and disassembled. Now I'm in the market for a new coffee grinder.\n",

The graphics are very in-your-face, however (Being an arachnophobe, I nearly fell off my chair when a spider jumped out at me!). I admit, if you are into adventure games with a little more action, I reccomend the Lord Of The Rings games or The Chronicles Of Narnia: Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe.

After collaborating with the Germans in the genocide against the Jews in 1942, the Ukrainian nationalists abandoned German service and formed genocidal bands directed at defenseless Polish civilians.

What it comes down to, once i adjusted to the way this (and frankly most...) protectors are, watery (opposed to the hairspray-like salone protection i used)its my go-to when i'm low and dont have much money. its about three to four dollars so i just stock up when i can and itll last me a fair while...for the price, and its effectablility i give it a five. I would recommend this. However, there are better out there.\n",

      "__label__2 Light and no grease!: I was really skeptical about this product. In the past I have used products like this and found that they tend to leave my hair heavy, sticky, and not manageable. However I was really suprised by this product. I used as the instructions said and some detangler and blow dried my hair. It came out just as soft as it normally would have without anything in it (but now I get the heat protection).Very impressed. Although I purchased this item at Target for about $2.99 so you can probably find it a little cheaper somewhere else.\n",
      "__label__1 Hated it: Wow not sure why so many good reviews for this. It made my hair feel nasty and caked up. I won't be purchasing again. I guess everyone is different. I have dry hair to begin with and this made it much worse with a very unnatural feel to it afterwards. If you are going to buy I would look for the best price for only one bottle. I got three bottles of this crap and most of it went down the sink so that it wasn't laying around in the \" crappy cosmetics abyss\".Good luck\n",
      "__label__1 Very dissapointed...: I normally am very pleased with sony products, but this one has been very dissappointing. It has (in the middle of the night) re-set itself to the wrong time on numerous occasions. Just this morning I fed the baby at what I thought was 4:30 am. It looked too light outside so I checked another clock and sure enough, it was actually 6:30am. My husband, who normally wakes up at 5:30 am, was late for work this morning. This has happened several times.\n",

The time regularly just jumps to a random time in the middle of the night. Because of this, I've been late to work a few times. I can not stress how disappointed I am, or discourage people strongly enough not to buy this alarm clock.\n",
      "__label__1 Worst Clock Radio Ever: It's no surprise Sony discontinued this item. This is the worst clock radio I've ever owned. There are a number of problems with this item:- The radio-controlled clock-auto-adjust function does not work at all in my location.- ALL settings including time, alarms and radio presets are lost whenever power is lost.- The display is difficult to read at a distance or at a slight angle.\n",
      "__label__1 Left Me Cold: I was really looking for a book on how to use Bluetooth and what the applications were. This book is written for the geek and techno junky market and not the kind of person who wants to have the latest gadgets in their home and workplace. I was really frustrated to read on and on about profiles (what?) and technical data flow charts. The screen shots were the most useful part of the book.\n",
      "__label__1 Fine in Principle, Faulty in Execution: How and why the Grail translation of the Psalms found its way into the prayer of the Church disconcerts me. The rendering of Psalm 110 (Psalm 109 in the Douay-Rheims Bible), for example, is grievious. Striking at the heart of the Church's prayer (i.e., the Psalms) strikes at the heart of the Church's belief. The insipid \"modernization\" of the Glory Be and other traditional prayers has me scratching my head, too: who takes it upon themselves to even do this, then publish it and disseminate it among the faithful, anyway?I eventually gave up on this volume, out of frustration, and began praying the Psalms with the Douay-Rheims Bible and the Latin Vulgate, learning a little Latin as I went on. God willing, I would soon like to get the Latin Breviary.In addition, due to similar dissatisfaction with ICEL's treatment of the liturgical texts, I've purchased the 1962 Missal and begun to attend the Tridentine Mass--thanks be to God!\n",
      "__label__2 Beyond inspiring: I cannot believe I am the first person to review this movie. An overwhelming story of hope in spite of unbelievable sufferering, and yet full of surprising humor. I was afraid it would be dull and heart-breaking, but I was surprised at the humor especially when the boys first come to the US.Their perspective on the US culture is very sobering and still hopeful. Everyone should see this movie especially young people. What these men have been through is beyond inspiring. It challenges me to make the most of my opportunities.\n",

As you drink this concoction down you experience memories of place and family that, if you are flesh and blood, are real for you. You don't have to be Southern to understand this cd. You just have to have lived among the species human. Because \"Middlin' Sisters\" is, for me, about the essence, the rue, the drippings of joyful, loving, unvarnished, god awful humanity. From \"Trella's Trash\" to \"Line Up\" you'll think to yourself \"I know that person...I've been to that place...that IS my family.\" If you've ever had a drunk uncle or an aunt you adored or a grandmother with a switch in her hand, you know \"Middlin Sisters\".

This project included the Album Favorite: \"Good Love\". Although this project only had 8 Tracks, I'm pretty sure it wasn't going to kill album sells by pulling a 4th Single (Ehich could have been \"Good Love\"), but when everything was said and done Anita Baker had another Top Selling Gold Album!!!\n",
      "__label__1 Jane Austin would be outraged: I found the story line of this book very tedious and unbelievable, however that was not the worst of it. There were so many places in the story where it seemed that the author must have been reading Pride and Prejudice as she was writing that it made the whole work ridiculous. Conversations and situations so mimicked Austin's books that it bordered on plagiarism Vert disappointing\n",
      "__label__2 Breathtaking Story for East and West: Believe me, as soon as I move with the story of novel, the irresistible force dragged the reader with such strength that reader forgets who has written the novel.The major messages of this novel are to the western readers - wonderfully affectionate mothers and ever lasting friendship across genders. Both tragedies and comedies overlook each other, ultimately all the characters combine into an active group in the memory of Vasavi, go back to soil, resounding what great Tagore wrote, \"Lets go back to earth\", which took shape of developmental NGO, PRAGATI, which is a dream in our life, not unreasonably. Once started reading this novel, one remains breathless till the novel ends. The contour of the novel is never and no where flat, rather full of ups and downs, lovely twists and bents. Surely this novel will win hearts of many western readers who lack emotion about mother and friendship\n",

The unit puts out a nice amount of heat and extends the season we can sit outside. it is simple and trouble free to light.

      "__label__1 Volumes: As much as I love Family Guy, I still can't understand this volume business. Thirty to forty dollars for 12-13 half hour episodes is not acceptable. Smallville and Battlestar Galactica charge that much for entire seasons composed of 20-22 one hour episodes (for seasons one and three for BSG, anyway, since I still don't understand the 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, and 4.5 crap, but I waited for the price to drop on those as well).And on top of that, the packaging of previous volumes has been done away with for the cheaper flip box. If a premium price is going to be charged, then I expect premium services.So my complaint isn't the show, which I still give five stars to, but the price and packaging. I did my usual thing of waiting and waiting and the price eventually came down, but lets be serious. Shouldn't have to do that.\n",
      "__label__1 Fox is greedy: First of all, I love Family Guy from the day it premiered on Fox, but why can't they (Fox and I'm sure Seth has a hand in it too) release all 20-21 episodes per season on one volume like they did for Volume 2 (season 3). After that volumes 4-8 are all 13 episodes per volume at $30+ each. Greed is what I call it and in this economy, its outrageous. I don't know about you but I'll wait until it drops to $19.99 or less before I'll buy it. Same goes for American Dad.Oh and about the writer's strike, just an excuse to only release the 13 episodes per volume. Fox could have waited for the strike to be over and release full seasons per volume and the year the strike happened, release that season and price it appropriately for the short fall of episodes.\n",

      "__label__2 A Pearl From A Pulp Shell: I became familiar with this character totally by chance. When the paperback collection was released in the 70s, I was baited by the tag line calling him a \"supernatural Sherlock Holmes\". The stories are well written almost to the point of classic literature, introducing characters with a taste for excitement, a never-ending knowledge of the bizarre and an interesting sense of justice (The Corpse-Master from \"the Casebook Of Jules de Grandin\" is an excellent example this.) Who cares if a few of the stories were a little campy, even those tales were fun to read. Since I bought the collection in the seventies, I've lost two of the volumes to \"Acts Of God\" but the four survivors have remained a treasured part of my library, worthy of rereading several times.\n",

I originally used this book as a text, and keep it now as a reference when I need to recall details about a technique. For those without any science background, it may be a challenge, but if you have the interest, it would be a lot of fun.

Directing, acting, cinematography and story are all uniformly bad, along with ridiculous makeup. \"The Dude\" below, is one of the actors in the film as no sane person who would ever see this piece of excrement as anything other than a painfully low talented effort at filmmaking.

This andFactory Showroomare probably the only two TMBG albums that I would say are winners straight through (although I haven't listened to their kids albums - yet). Others, like Apollo 18 or The Else, are a mix of hits and misses, but these two just keep on delivering. And of course, this album contains Birdhouse In Your Soul, probably the single best song the Johns have recorded.If you're here because you've bought their music for your kids and are curious what their adult music sounds like, Flood is absolutely the place to start.\n",

Compared to Epson's paper, the Canon is the closest film developed on paper! The Canon paper is smooth, shiny and the colors are vivid. Without the perforations, the paper looks like it's developed professionally. Every package comes wrapped in a clear plastic sealed bag, and inside are the 20 sheets of photo paper along with a soft tissue paper to protect the first sheet, and a hard cardboard on the back to keep the photos nice and flat.The only problem is that the surface of the Canon Photo Paper Pro is that it's easily to scratch when rubbing against other paper or your fingernail. It's not too noticable unless you look at it in an angle in the light.But overall, it's the best paper for 4\"x6\" photos you want to print yourself!

Common sense I know, but give yourself some room to remove the handgun without banging it on the sides, or under the lip of the sides, or even having to finagle it out of the vault completely. I intended to place a .38 Special revolver in it, BUT the tip of grip to tip of barrel was just a tad too long. So now I either buy a new, smaller handgun, or a bigger vault! Also, there is not a 9volt battery included, so you should have one ready so you can program your new code immediately. It's a GREAT gun vault. I just didn't measure twice first.\n",

This DVD, with three solo songs and the rest with his amazing band, comes as close to capturing that feeling as video possibly can. The sound quality ranks with the finest concert recordings of all time. Paul has found the ultimate blend of rock, blues, gospel, classic R&B; and country. He and this band sound like no one you have ever heard and that's exceedingly rare anymore. The DVD and bonus live CD are one the greatest values in recorded music you will ever find.

      "__label__2 The quintessential Cure album!: This is by far my favorite Cure record. It's the only CD that I own that I don't skip songs on...everything flows, the mood is never interrupted, and the words conjure images as clear as photographs in the listener's mind. The Cure excel musically on this record as few bands ever will, and the poignancy and wistfullness of Robert Smith's words is touching, moving and exhilarating. Behind the tapestry of instrumental genius lies a raw emotion seldom found in rock music. I recommend this CD to anyone who doesn't already own it; this is one record that makes the listener participate in the artist's vision.\n",
      "__label__1 Do not order from Hastings: I'd rate this zero stars if i could. I ordered \"The Cure: Disintegration\" on NEW VINYL. I received a USED CD. When I called, I was told I could return the item and they would expedite the correct item to me (this is a Christmas gift and I would now receive it after the 25th). Once I went to my email to print the return label, there was a note saying they could not exchange the item and I would just have to return the incorrect item. I am very upset with this poor customer service and such miscommunication. Now my boyfriend will not be receiving this item for Christmas, and Hastings is refusing to send the correct item\n",
      "__label__1 Garbage: Disintegration is right...The Cure were best when they did fun pop songs, like in the 80's and early 90's! Pop songs are what gets played on radio, and the radio is the only sure sign of what's good in music.Obviously this album doesn't get played on the radio.I took a chance with this album, thinking it would feature the \"fun\" rock side of Robert Smith. Alas, it's totally boring rock. I understand that The Cure wanted to try their talented hands at ethereal rock or whatever, but this stuff just drags on and on and on like a movie or something. Yes, it's very cinematic; cinematic with Smith's mopey vocals, which sound so much better when he's in a good mood. And why wouldn't the guy be in a good mood? HE MAKES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS!! Simply put, this album is too long, too brooding, and too ambitious in scope.For people in college only.TAKE CARE!!!\n",

Everything from Pillow Talk, That Touch of Mink, Please Don't Eat the Daisies, Send Me No Flowers, Do Not Disturb, etc, Doris is, by far, one of the best in romantic comedies. Pair her with any leading man and she nails it. Rod Taylor, James Garner, David Nivens, Cary Grant and Rock Hudson. Having these guys as her better halves was tv couple-pairing at its best.\n",

HE works all the time--SHE hangs around the mansion with nothing to do except dress up (A spectacular wardrobe is the THIRD STAR). I think this one is PRETTY BAD (except for HER WARDROBE). Stuff happens, but most of it is DRIVEL--not even worth mentioning.I REALLY DO NOT UNDERSTAND ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS. Good is good. Bad is bad. THIS ONE IS BAD.\n",
      "__label__1 This cd had the right idea, but somehow failed: My interest in Michael goes back to the mid 80's, when he first went out on his own. I have most of his cds and really enjoy his voice. The concern I have for this cd as well as his other cds is material content. Michael usually does't choose the songs that I enjoy listening to. He chooses a repertoire that is not necessary the big hits of yester year. One thing i'm certain of is that Michaels' voice always sounds good on all songs.With the voice of Michael on the so called great songs, I think that he would have one great cd after another. Perhaps he should take my suggestion and try this new approach to song selection. There's really nothing to loose and a lot of gain.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd.\n",

It suggests reading from translations that have problems with them. I am a person that is King James only.\n",

Rarely have I felt so ripped off.The cast plaster stones don't look even close to stone, but I guess it's a good thing they aren't as there is nothing to hold them together (aside from gravity) and it might be even more annoying to put them back together after they fall apart from being slightly bumped.I would also think as they are just cheap plaster casts, one might actually be able to make them fit the product they were made to surround... But they don't. There's about a half inch gap all around where you can see through to the cheap legs the thing uses to prop up the Fire Dancer in the middle.Don't throw your money away.

Maybe in concept only! The Shelly Cashman Series is usually very good, but the proofreaders were WAY overworked with this one. There are several errors in the tutorials that make it VERY frustrating to use if you are just learning JavaScript. I find the code testy enough without sloppy work on the writer/editors/proof-reader/publishers 's part. I have spent HOURS to get the tutorials to work, in some cases just having to cut bait. Folks at the publishers, take this one home and try it out. I'm tempted to send you back my corrected book with the multiple errors that I have found. Fix the mistakes and try it again. Gentle readers, this one is ONE TO AVOID.\n",

Page 1.8 shows the program list, with some Win 95 programs. Now that most people are coding on Windows 7, how can this really be relevant? They need an updated version that fits with computers we use today. Page 5.22 shows ancient computers in a shopping cart.

      "__label__2 Great Fun---Glad It's a Series: I happened upon this series by accident, and a lucky accident it was. I've been reading the books in order. The series doesn't disappoint and I thought this book was the best so far. There's an immaculate confection (no, it's not Doug Flutie with icing,) skullduggery in the vestry, a maybe miracle, and a developing romance. In addition to the central mystery, each book also contains the main character's wonderfully horrible Raymond Chandleresque novella. The writing is clever and the language is an absolute joy and laugh-out-loud funny. Bar none, the novellas have the very best awful mile-long similes ever written.Although much of the plot involves an Episcopal Church, the story is neither preachy nor sacrilegious. The plot moves along quickly, the characters are likeable, and the stories are great fun. The price of the books is a steal. I'll probably regret saying all this because the publisher will jack up the price. Be that as it may, this is a fun read.\n",

The Pixies may have been the last truly fresh and original band to come out.\n",
      "__label__2 Surprisingly there are those, that aren&#65533;t familiar with this: Having always seemingly been compared to \"Nirvana\"...this does the `Pixies' little justice, as this...their best album is a far more multi-tentacled beast than anything `Nirvana' has done. First track \"Debaser\" is an ambitious accessible straight out the bag College Rock track that is one of those tracks that anybody who's heard the album always mentions. But it would be foolish to not equally praise their other exceptional tracks, \"I Bleed\" giving a gloomy take on Ironic Pop, but its the irresistibility of \"Here Comes your man\" that invokes images of `The Velvet Underground' at their very best...often bemused by peoples perception of their as a populist band, singer/frontman \"Black Francis\" Quoted as saying...\"Everyone thinks the Pixies were a incredibly popular band, but we were just a Cult band\". Cult band or not...they are one of the most consistently brilliant Rock/Grunge albums bands ever devised.\n",

I've never bought a used CD on line before, but I trust Amazon, so I added it to my most recent order. I am THRILLED to have these songs back again. I don't always like Linda Ronstadt, but the songs on this album, especially w/ Aaron Neville, are awesome. The actual CD case was slightly scratched, but well worth it to save over $20!

However, the Rheingold suffers from the same terrible remastering that afflicts their 1953 Forza remastering. On headphones the voices are all shoved over to one side with the orchestra on the other and there is artificial reverb added - I understand the last three operas are better but I didn't bother .

All the good stuff about PM5K (the sci-fi themes, space suits, the nice vocals) have all gone away, and turned into just anothers simple alt band. PM5K should have relased anyone for doomsday, because we would have different to listen to that sounds like what PM5K should song like, other than the amazing Tonight The Stars Revolt. I am PM5K fan, and I hope they don't continue going down this road on the next albums.\n",

But now after just 4 month the modem in the Tivo set is broken, which means it can't dial into the program guide etc. anymore. this means Tivo is pretty much useless. I thought this should be not a big deal until I found out [what it costs to] send in the set to Philips (plus shipping). Just to repair the modem!!! I get a whole new set for that price! Besides the fact that Philips seems to have a problem with their customer service (the average hold time is 45 minutes - I tried it every day during the last 2 weeks). Tivo is great if it works but the machine itself seems to have some mechanical problems that they need to fix before I will buy a set again. If you buy it, just buy it with a warranty.\n",

Setup was a bit time consuming and required a trip to Radio Shack for some additional cables, but the instructions are detailed and easy to follow.There are four or five shows we like to watch weekly and we are now free to see them at our leisure. Too tired to watch ER or Saturday Night Live? Need to go to a school meeting on Wednesday night but don't want to miss West Wing? Want to watch Seinfeld reruns? No problem. Watch them when you like. And the pause feature is fantastic. Make yourself a sandwich; Take the call from your mother. The show is waiting for you when you return. We now rarely watch live TV because TIVO has recorded other stuff we'd rather see than the usual dreck. You'll never need to watch another annoying commercial. We LOVE this thing!

      "__label__2 Evolve or Dissolve!: To anybody who feels that metal should stay stagnant in their progress of their evolution should then stay with Linkin Park, Trapt or Godsmack. If you do you won't ever be disappointed. For those of you who take great pride in watching some of your favorite bands take the next step in musical progress should then take a hardy bite out of this album. Coined with the category \"Math Metal\" by Chad Grey this band is as distant from Nu-Metal as Tool or Deftones as I have heard it described by some. This album blends the raw vocals and unpredictable time signatures of \"LD50\" with the melody of their follow up album \"The End of All Things to Come\" and then pushed the envelope a little more. Mudvayne is much more polished and for that I commend them. And also for that they are a much superior band than they used to be. So get your @$$ moving and pick up this album. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "__label__1 World owes you recognition, but you owe yourselves progress.: It's trite to re-interpret the title into the critique, but I can't help regarding `Lost and Found' as all too fitting. The best aspects seem like B-sides, while the other two thirds remind the world why radio-potential metal has become so disposable.And Mudvayne is supposed to help us forget.It's painful to imagine that they've hit a creative wall, worse to conceive that they would weaken themselves so as not to intimidate promoters, but I hear those riffs that were worn out 20 years ago and I just don't know. The experimental sharpness is still floating around in here, but it's measured with points rather than an edge.Gather the mob-funds, guys. But come back and remind us how much more you have to give.\n",

So I was prepared to like this product.I'm not very sensitive to product scents; I will use most anything if it makes my hair look good. This one is an exception, though. It smells terrible -- to my nose it's a combination of watermelon, dead fish, and baby powder -- and the smell does not go away as the product settles and dries. I couldn't even give this a second test try because it smelled so bad. It did make my hair shiny, but there is no way I could possibly use it. Bummer! I see that a couple other reviewers have liked it, though, so it's definitely a subjective matter and not everyone would find the smell so objectionable.\n",
      "__label__1 Tune Out This Book: Sorry, but if you want to broadcast for more than a few feet, this book is not for you. This book is a collection of low-powered simple circuits, backed with high-powered marketing. The back cover states, \"Now that the FCC has changed the laws governing pirate radio and video stations....\" While there is now a low-power FM service, for which a type-accepted transmitter and license are still required, there have been no \"changes\" governing pirate broadcasting. It's still illegal (and fun). And there is nothing in this book that is going to save you \"thousands of dollars\" over commercial equipment, while giving you the same power and performance. These statements are clearly misleading and get your hopes up (and your wallets out) for something this book is not. It's unfortunate that the author, who is probably capable of doing so, did not write a book to match the promised content.\n",
      "__label__1 Don't bother: To be frank, I found this trilogy so be the absolute worst book that I have ever read (it was an omnibus). The 'hero' spent most of his time whining, and making everyone else suffer along with him. The writing was well done, but the plot and characters were hopeless. Don't waste your time plowing through it...\n",
      "__label__1 Like wading thru cold maple syrup: I will say that Donaldson's settings and concept were unique at the time of this series's conception. It might even be said that he revitalized an ailing genre with his well thought out epic. But be warned; this novel will leave intellectually spent. Covenant is perhaps the most indecisive, whiny fantasy \"hero\" I've ever read. I find him thorougly dislikable. He's the kind of guy you don't ask \"how ya doing?\" because he'll take an hour telling exactly what's wrong with his life.\n",

Found it really stupid and kind of arrogant in the use of language, like he was trying too hard to impress you with obscure words (and I like to think I have a pretty good vocabulary).

Main character too angry and couldn't seem to get over it. Wore me out.\n",

It's like trying to remember how it felt to have a stainless steel spike driven thru your skull.The \"Hero\" is annoying, winey and while reading this book, I longed for his death or disappearance. The book is a slow, hard read. If your thing is reading about people you'd never want to run into/ know (and that's our \"Hero\"), then this book is for you!How this book has had a run as a series of books is beyond me.

      "__label__2 A Beautiful Epic of Tolkien Proportions: Donaldson's Thomas Covenant books are masterworks of creative joy, frustration, and eventually triumph. Both the frustration and triumph stem from the intricacies of a complex anti-hero whom the reader will alternately want to curse and salute. The first book, Lord Foul's Bane, is not without flaws, and it does begin slowly as others have noted, but the committed reader will be rewarded with an epic of Tolkien proportions and a world which is painful to depart once the last page is done. I have returned to this series many times over the years, and it holds a place of honor in my collection.\n",

There is a breadth of tone and subject matter, though all the songs come from Billy Bragg's perspective, and are quite political in nature. To specifically address one criticism on this site, Billy did not write a new tune for 'The Red Flag', he states that he is returning the lyrics to their ORIGINAL tune, which is a lively Irish reel; the effect is to give the song the energy and enthusiam it requires.\n",

The ability to set both alarms to the radio (this sounds simple, but many CD clock radios (Timex, Panasonic) allow a sound source to be associated with only one of the alarms). Good sound. Very good looks. But unlike most clock radios, it does not have a battery backup. As my area periodically gets short blackouts, this is needed. Especially since getting to work depends upon it.

      "__label__1 Deeply Disappointing (sooo glad I only rented it): I was so disappointed with this film: the acting was second rate at best, the greatest offender being the scene with woman at the well (John 4). The ongoing interaction with the Jewish leaders was utterly painful to watch. I remember being so excited about this film, I thought about buying it even before watching it. So glad I only rented it. Believe me, I had heard so many positive things about the film, it made finally watching it even more disappointing. Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\" and the recent \"The Nativity Story\" are so superior in production value, with the finest movie on the life of Jesus Christ remaining Franco Zeffirelli's \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" I'd certainly recommend these over \"The Gospel of John.\"\n",
      "__label__2 Great video!: The best video concerning any gospel that I have ever seen. Stays strictly with what the gospel says and no personal interpretations.\n",
      "__label__2 Wow: Love the dvd. Henry C is perfect as Jesus and the biblical account of John is spot on the bible. No \"Hollywood\" embellishments in this area. the video leaves you feeling like you've witnessed Christ first hand and its very peaceful and satisfying. Buy this!\n",
      "__label__1 What they don't tell you: Unfortunately this product was not labeled for use in the US only. I cannot view the DVD in Australia. So 'buyer beware'. What a rip off. I had to give it one star because the system would allow none.\n",
      "__label__2 What better a witness then the WORD itself: I like the Movie because it is not common to see far straying from the WORD, yet it is drawn from the Alexandrian texts which are gnostic, droping many words, and even entire verses (compare NIV 1John 5:7 to NKJV or KJV). Another thing Isaih said the real LORD was not comely (handsom), nor did he have any form (was not well built). Also Mary Magdeline near the end, gets a lot of camara time for some reason, and keeps acting fluttery. All in all I would watch it several times without feeling like I was wasting time, because any of HIS words are enriching.Praise the LORD Jesus, HE has\"magnified HIS WORD above HIS NAME\" Psalm 138:2b,\"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\" Romans 10:17,JESUS is alive, HE is risen, HE healed my broken heart, and gave me a new life in HIM.\n",
      "__label__2 The BEST: This is the best Jesus video I have ever seen in my life! It comes in two DVD's, the full length and a shorter one. The man playing Jesus was an actor on LOST. He does a truly inspired portrayal of Christ and you have no problem relating to Him.\n",
      "__label__2 SUPERB FILM: THIS IS THE ONLY BIBLICAL BASED MOVIE THAT IS ACTUALLY ACCURATE WORD-FOR-WORD TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURE. HENRY IAN CUSICK IS PHENOMENAL AS THE MESSIAH; HE IS THE BEST ACTOR CAST AS JESUS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE DIRECTING IS AMAZING AND CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER AS NARRATOR IS PERFECT. I PERSONALLY WATCH THIS MOVIE ON A REGULAR BASIS, IT IS TRULY THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL BROUGHT TO LIFE.\n",

      "__label__2 I Can't Believe It Came From Memphis But Then Again I Can: This is a very pleasant collection of songs from a young Memphian I can only call \"ultra-modern\". I live in Memphis. I know Memphis is mostly about Elvis, Sam and Dave, Al Green, Sam the Sham, Carla and Rufus Thomas, Booker T and the MGs, Charlie Rich, Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Three Six Mafia, all sorts of rockabilly and soul and gutbucket and rap. But this is really great, too, in a completely different way, more like Big Star and Alex Chilton when he's not really angry and bitter. This is ethereal and damn near giddy music... it's intelligent, rooted in 60's white pop with a carefully crafted psychedelic edge. It floats along, pulls you in and...well, it makes you feel happy. It's ultra-modern -- nobody else sounds like this -- and it's very smart. I can't wait for the follow-up. I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go.\n",

Well, even if he's stealing stuff from John McPhee, I really enjoyed Fallen Man, and I think he's getting even better with First Eagle. I enjoy a good knotty plotline and both of these books deliver. One more note, quite frankly, I never really could stand Janet Pete. Chee needs to stop moping and go after Bernie.\n",
      "__label__1 I eagerly anticipated this book and was disappointed.: This book was not up to the standards I have come to expect in Tony Hillerman's Chee and Leaphorn series. The plot was convoluted and yet uninteresting and formulaic. Chee and Leaphorn in previous books had appealing personal characteristics. In this book, all the characters were ho-hum.\n",

You can listen to the first ten seconds of \"Donna Lee\", right from the opening hit of the drums, through to the beauty of \"Forgotten Love\" and realize this is some pretty hot stuff!Best tracks are \"Continuum\", \"Portrait Of Tracy\", \"Okonkole Y Trompa\" and \"Forgotten Love\". \"Kuru/Speak Like A Child\" ain't bad either.The bonus tracks are alright, but the general album is more interesting.In my opinion, one of the most accomplished works by one of the most accomplished, if not the accomplished player of all time!\n",
      "__label__2 I dig this.: I knew what I was getting when I picked this up, pretty much your standard random-members-band with random vocalists and Paul Di'Anno the man himself from the first two Maiden albums. This is good, not absolutely earth-shattering, but that's not the point of these things, as they are tributes by artists who love the band. I gotta say that so far, the Steve Grimmett tracks have to be my favorites, he even comes close to Bruce Dickinson's greatness at times. Di'Anno's, while great, seem to be lacking something in the delivery, but that just might be the fact that he's older than he was when he originally recorded them. Then there's Bernie Shaw singing \"Fear of the Dark\" which was great to me because I'm a huge Uriah Heep fan and he definitely brings some of that spirit to the song. All in all, a pretty standard tribute, definitely recommended to all Maiden fans!!!\n",

I use them for work and they hold up to the 8-12 hours I'm on my feet, I placed my orthotics on top of the insole so thay might be why.The Navy color looks drab grey after washing so I don't recommend that color and I haven't washed the glossy black I have yet.

They look OK, but they feel cheap on my feet, and I won't buy another pair. I wish I had returned them, but thought that if I bought better insoles they would be comfortable, but they really aren't, and I have to wear extra thick socks with these although I still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes.

That is completely unacceptable. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. Apparently this happens with great frequency. Save $50 and much aggravation and check out the Sony Fontopia's. Those lasted me a year which prior to this was dissapointing. I spent the extra money for increased durability and was completely wrong. You don't get what you pay for.

They don't sound quite as good as the higher end (Ultimate Ears or Shure), but good for the money. They are a tiny bit thin on the Bass, but better than most in their price range. If you need more bass, check out the V-MODA Bass Respone phones.They do need a \"burn-in\" period though to reach their capability.\n",

It was very scratchy every time something not even that high would be playing...The lows were good BUT they do not make up for the highs.

I used it fairly actively ran a lot with it walked everywhere with them on etc.Now first thing to go was the metal sleeve on the 3.5 connector, it was sliding off and whatever no big deal this happened about a month in. Then the next thing to go was my left ear buds insulating wire, exposing it slowly, still worked fine but it was slowly dieing, then near the connector the insulation broke there too exposing the wire. Then the right earbud's wire was exposed then the left one stopped working altogether. That's when I got new earbudsOverall, i wouldn't buy these again, almost got tempted since i noticed it had a different design on the connector so i thought maybe they got better, but this time i'm gonna heed other peoples reviews and still not get them.\n",
      "__label__1 They didn't even last me TWO months!: I bought these on June 6, 2009 and they gave out on me two nights ago (August 19, 2009)! One of the ears just up and stopped working! I have to constantly adjust the wiring just so that the dead ear bud can come back. What's the point of this high grade wire protector if they're just going to give out anyway!? And at $50+ I expected much more from this...FAR more. AT LEAST a year...if they had lasted me at least a year then I'd at least be satisfied with my purchase, but sadly that was not the case. Cheap non-name brand ear buds from CVS lasted me longer than these things! Avoid these, people. Lest you want to suffer the same frustration I experienced. I'm going to try and see if I can't get a new or refurbished pair from the manufacturer. This shoddy overpriced merchandise cannot go on like this!\n",
      "__label__1 Good sound, Bad quality: I bought the red version of these earbuds in January 2008 after tons of research. A lot of the negative reviews I read were about the earbuds shorting out. In my case, after about 2 months, I noticed that the left earbud was now playing at a MUCH reduced volume. At first I thought it was just the stereo mixing of music, but then I realized that, indeed, the volume and bass coming from the left ear bud was very quiet, and now it annoys me to listen to. A couple of months in and I'm SOL - especially since I bought them for $65 on Amazon without a warranty. Splurge for buying them from the manufacturer so you can get them repaired.PROS: Sounds good, look great, easy to get in and out of ears (compared to Shure).CONS: They are already shorted. :(\n",
      "__label__2 Very nice: I was searching for some ear buds to replace the standard iPod issue. I got a pair of Shure e2c's for Xmas and have never been able to get them to fit my ears no matter what fitting I used. After much experimentation I was able to get some of the foam fittings to work but the sound was still lacking. No bass at all. After doing some reading I decided to take a chance on the V-MODA Vibes. At first I was a little concerned they might be to bassie. Well, that is not the case. The bass is definitley there but it's not overwhelming by any means. So far I like the V-MODAs a lot. I was able to wear them right out of the box - I haven't even tried any of the other fittings. Plus they're not as clunky as the Shures. The smaller size enables me to fit almost the entire bud in my ear. I am quite pleased with my purchase. Anyone interested in a slightly used pair of e2c's?\n",

      "__label__1 Extra Noise: One of the worst purchases I have made. The cords to the earbuds are fabric covered and rub against clothing, creating load rubbing background noise that is high decibel and louder than the music being delivered. I have to binder clip them to my collar to get them to be acceptible. Hate them.\n",
      "__label__2 Great sound...but be sure to save receipt: Title says it all. Left channel/bud started to fade after 3 months of use. Never used earphones with ipod in pocket, so bending of cord was unlikely cause of fault.That said, Vmoda stood behind their product, and provided a quick exchange via mail with proof of purchase.Big picture: Tremendous value and sound. Earbuds are great for passive noise reduction of piped guido music at health club and aircraft noise.\n",

      "__label__2 Good sound, but not as noise insulating as I hoped: I bought these primarily to use on my commute. I had read they were great at insulating outside noise. I ride a very noisy public transit train in the SF Bay Area and these earbuds really don't block out enough sound. The train wheels just scream on the tracks in some sectinos. These are comfortable and the sound quality of the music is good but if you are looking for something to insulate outside noise, these won't really do it.\n",

However, they crapped out after about two months. I returned them and went with a cheaper set of headphones.I was craving some nice headphones, and I saw the price on these is substantially down from 2008, so I bought them again (spring 2010).

BUT, the sensor that raises the lid is too wide of range. Walk by within 2ft and lid opens, runs battery down quickly. Have gotten in habit of turning off, except will doing food prep for period of time. The function of no touch use 24-7 was what I was looking forward to. Turning on/off for most of daily use defeats the no touch perk.\n",

This could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy, which will save you money, mess, and time.\" is an OUTRIGHT LIE. This garbage can lid worked for about 15 months at best. It no longer opens wide enough to put trash in, and the lid only stays up for a second, if that. Totally useless, overpriced terrible product.\n",

We all loved it, it was so convenient! The infrared sensor was iffy, sometimes it doesn't respond, but I had no problem pushing the open button, which worked fine to me. After 6 months though, the lid won't open either with the open button or the infrared sensor. Fresh batteries notwithstanding, I have to dig my fingernail under the lid to open it. Sure, the close button still works, but shouldn't I expect that my garbage can should outlive my garbage?Thank goodness I bought this at Costco, I can return it for a full refund even after 6 months. I'm going to get a reliable and durable step can and skip the $10 of batteries altogether. Good idea, but unreliable technology makes this a loser in the end.\n",

Secondly, because it opens automatically, I spill less and do not dirty the can by touching it constantly. I have had one for two months and am pleased with the performance. Use regular kitchen bags. Getting the kitchen bags in isn't the simplest task, but it does hold the bag in well. Cleans easily. I would recommend.\n",

We had house warming few days ago, and everyone who came to the house warming asked where did you buy this. We have two kids, we thought they may play with it, but not at all. The negative aspect of the touchless is to sensitive, even if you walk near by your dress make them to open many time and secondly I feel the time limit of lid opening bit shorter.

Easy to operate (once you get the hang of putting in the trash liner which is not really that difficult but you have to make sure the inner ring is in the correct position). Looks clean and neat. Space saving. The reason we didn't give it a 5 star rating is: (1) I couldn't figure out how to give it 4.5 stars; (2) the lid sometimes goes up when you walk close to it (not a real big problem for us but if you had a large family it might); and (3) it would have been really good to have the choice of an adapter so that it could be plugged in. Not real draw backs and none of these have really been a problem but items worth noting. I would order again and have recommended to friends (even those who laughed).

Now-a-days, the door only opens 1/3 of the way. When this first started, my first thought was to change the batteries. When that didn't work, I thought it was due to the batteries being old. So I went and bought new D size batteries. They weren't the cheap dollar store batteries. I bought Energizer batteries just to make sure that they would be full power. Sadly, this has not worked either.So 5 months ago, this trash can was a 5 star. Now it is a 2 star. Unfortunately I expect products to last at least a year before I replace them.

I was at first very pleased with the product, but within a few days, the rim kept falling inside the can, the batteries kept falling out because the battery cover was not secure. Ended up exchanging the whole can to try it again. I feel this could be a excellent product if the battery compartment were on the back of the lid inside of underneath. Thats the way my previous trash can was made.\n",
      "__label__1 The battery cover didn't fit: I could no way close the battery cover. So I duck-taped it to hold the baerries. But the batteries were too heavy and they became loose and pushed the cover down into the can. This apparently happened when I emptied the can for the first time. (I ordered this on 1/14/2010.) Sometime after that I realized it stopped working, and found that the cover was permanently lost (to the town dump). I duck-taped the batteries directly into the slot, but after a few hours (maybe a few minutes?) the tape could no longer hold the heavy weight of 4 D-batteries, and became loose. So the trash can is totally useless. Had I bought this from Costco, I would take it to the store and they would refund me. But unfortunately I bought it through amazon.com (I had also threw away the box.) I'll just have to throw this trash can into my trash bin to go to the town trash tump. What a trash product it is. If amazon.com keeps selling products like this it will become a trash company as well.\n",
      "__label__1 Lid Does not Fit can...: Been using this can for well over a few months now and am now getting around to writing the review. When I first opened this trash can, the lid did not fit the can without an extreme amount of force. Every single time I change the trash bag, I have to literally fight to get the lid back on. Also, this trash can eats batteries like a fat kid eats cake...fast and often.Do not get this trash can!\n",
      "__label__2 Better than expected.: I purchased this really hoping it wasn't just a gimmick and it wasn't. It works beautifully, keeps the dog out, and was worth every penny.\n",
      "__label__2 Finally, a trash can that can do tricks: I really like this trash can. It automatically opens when you want it to, then shuts a few seconds later. I've only had a problem if I accidentally turn off the power switch in back. I've replaced the batteries only to discover the switch was turned off. My favorite thing about this trash can, however, is when guests come over! Stand in front of the trash can and pretend it's your pet. Say \"Who wants a treat???\" and after a few seconds get close enough so your hand trips the infrared and then toss the garbage in. Good boy!\n",
      "__label__1 over priced touchless trash can: I ordered this product & paid $100 plus for the item. I found the same identical item for $50.00 at Sams club. The plastic gear that controls the lid is way under engineered. It came apart in less than a year. This destroyed the touchless qualityTouch-Free Stainless Steel 13-Gallon Trash Can\n",
      "__label__1 Nice concept, but poor build quality: I received the trash can with several dents on its side, probably due to shipping. After examining the material it was made of, I concluded that the metal was very thin and flimsy. The dents caused the retainer ring to no longer fit properly in the can. I can say that the lid opening mechanism was very smooth and functional, but the poor build quality of the can itself is why I'm returning it.\n",
      "__label__1 Too expensive to only work for a year: I'm so sick of these fancy, expensive metal things where the crucial mechanism - in this case the hinge that opens the lid - relies on a tiny piece of flimsy plastic that breaks. This is a beautiful trash can that I liked while it worked, but the little plastic hinge broke and now it's garbage. I've had the same problem with pedal cans - the whole can is stainless steel EXCEPT for the part that should be, and that part inevitably breaks and leaves me with a useless piece of junk. Grrrr.\n",
      "__label__2 Love the product: I purchased this product two years ago and love it. However, there is one issue with it. As other reviewers stated the mechanism that lets the lid open and close broke off after one year. However, my husband was able to repair it by using super glue. This method worked two more times. Now, that trash can is two years old we can no longer repair it. We are now purchasing our second iTouchless trash can. I hope that they will think about selling the replacement for that mechanism so that when it breaks again we can purchase the part needed instead of the whole product.\n",
      "__label__1 13 gal touchless: Buyer Beware-The engineering is just terrible. The plastic gear that operates the lid is too small and broke early on, The battery compartment opens to the trash hence when the battery lid fails the lid and the batteries go out with the trash. Touchless sent me a new battery lid(10$ plus 4$ shipping) it smartly went out with the trash as well. After juryrigging the battery compartment with tape it worked for one more day then gave up the ghost and died. I now have a 100$ toy that doesn't work and only did work for a total of 8 weeks.\n",
      "__label__2 Time Tested: We have had ours for 4 1/2 years. It has served as our kitchen trash can in a busy home. I am back to buy another (my fault I broke it). Mine is in an area where people see it as they walk in. It is sharp-looking and free of bag overhang. My pets are not tempted to pull out trash since it is always contained. It has never malfunctioned. The only precautions I would pass along are that (1) it is easy to mistakenly dispose of the big plastic ring that hold the liner when one is taking out the trash; and (2) the plastic sheet covering the battery-pack fell off once and was carried away to the outside trash. I really hesitated when I purchased it ($$), but it turned out to be well worth it.\n",
      "__label__2 Great Product: Love this trash can, works exactly as stated. Small enough to fit where I want and large inside. Have had no problems to date.\n",

      "__label__2 great trash can: A great kitchen trash can, opens immediately, sleek design and great capacity. Push the button to the right and the top stays open when you have your hands full of veggie peelings. My husband does not like the ring inside the can which hold the bag in place, he says its too timing consuming to replace the trash bag. Overall, its one of the better trash cans I have ever used in the kitchen.\n",

Dare I say it but it's a fun album. I mean I know hip-hop now you got to be a \"THUG\" and all. This album just brings back good memories for me back in a time in 7th and 8th grade early 90s. The beats on this album still play to me and aren't out dated. For example, I brought Ice Cubs' 'The Predator' album just for the 'Check Yo Self' track but all the other song beats on that album are mad out dated. I don't know if your a young cat reading this or someone like me around 29, but this LP is just that good stuff! If you weren't around in 91 you might not be feeling me, but tracks for example; Feminat Fatt, Sobb Story, Show Me a Hero, were just my songs along with many more on this LP. I don't know, I just feel those good beats and the creativty on this album, still today!\n",
      "__label__2 Don't Need to Be a Plant Expert!: Although I very much enjoy books that simply educate me about certain plants, I am not able to remember all I need to know in a regular, timely fashion. This book, with its month to month format, overcomes that by reminding me to weed-n-feed my lawn, prune my summer flowering shrubs, plant bare root roses, and spray my fruit trees -- all in one chapter entitled, \"March\"! Also, great reading and pictures! Along with my Southern Living Garden Problem Solver book, I don't need any other gardening books!\n",

I read the reviews here and knew it might be too small (and it was), but I thought it was so pretty that I could use it for other things if not for the dessert dish. It really is a beautiful pan, but the one I received has a sort of pinkish tinge to the beige. I have other LeCreuset products, and none of them look quite like this.It's still pretty, though, and heats up well for cooking.\n",
      "__label__2 Buy This One for One of the Best Song Ever Written: Caruso: There are three songs on this CD.If you have seen the PBS Special, you like me were blown away by the powerful performance. She took this beautiful, compelling song that her mother used to sing, and brought it to a new level. Andrea Bocelli's and Pavarotti's version of CARUSO are no where as fulfulling as the Emotionally Packed, Exquisitely Crafted Masterpiece. This song is Reforged TIMELESS. Like she says, when you heard her interpretation of this song, you see, feel, breath, touch the Culture, Soul, History and Essence of ITALY. Not a Breath was wasted. Every nuance, tone, blend of emotions fell into place. I hope when upon listening this song for the very first time, you will be lifted and transported to another place and time. It is truly an unreal experience. Furthermore, Italian is truly a beautiful, expressive language.I bid you Love and Peace.\n",

Global temperatures peaked in 1998 and have declined since.2. The DVD says that there is one thing worse than more people is affluence. The DVD believes that more people are bad. It is based on the belief that the earth can only support a certain number of people. People have been producing alarmist documents for 200 years warning of the impending limits on population growth.

While this book might not have the same popular appeal as 'Jabez', I believe it presents a more balanced perspective on prayer through the study of ten unique prayers in the Bible.Even 10+ years later, the observations and lessons from this book still remain true.

I appreciate the efforts of reducing the amount of reading necessary to understand the concepts.If you are not a lazy student, you will have lots of case studies, news analysis, econ puzzles, and biographies to broaden your breath.

I get maybe a year out of them, which is perhaps 2 uses. I tried to replace the battery in one. It would be somewhat challenging for someone who did not have the necessary micro screw drivers and the patience to remove various items. Inside you will find a shoddy piece of electrical tape holding the battery in place - nice touch. After I installed a new battery, reassembled the gauge, and turned it on, I discovered that it reset itself to units that are unfamiliar to me, perhaps pascals. I never did figure out how to change the units. The price of the product is not worth the time I put into it anyway.I don't recommend this digital pressure gauge.\n",

When I first heard Once Again I wasn't sure I would like it, mainly due to my expectations based on Get Lifted. Once Again is not Get Lifted pt.2, it stands firmly on its own two feet, but you will get lifted (pun intended). John blends good old soul music with his own style to create wonderful songs such as \"Each Day Gets Better\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Where Did My Baby Go\", to name a few. You still get a Get Lifted feel with songs like \"Stereo\", \"Again\" and \"Another Again\". Of course John takes you to his Gospel roots with \"Heaven\" and \"Show Me\". This album has something for everyone, if you go in with an open mind you will come out with a musical experience you won't soon forget.\n",
      "__label__2 Cut from the same cloth as Marvin Gaye: I anxiously awaited this CD after his first CD \"Get Lifted\" became a smash hit. I actually anticipated somewhat of a sophomore fall off of sorts. You must admit that 1st CD is a tough act to follow. After listening to this CD for a couple of times, I felt it was not quite up to the standard set by his 1st. I mean the 2nd song \"heaven\" and the 7th \"slow dance\" are instant classics in my opinion. But it wasn't until I heard the CD several times, the 4th song \"show me\" and 6th \"p.d.a.\" started to really stand out. I believe as an artist he is as close as you get to the likes of Marvin Gaye. I just happened to hear \"Mercy Mercy Me\" by Marvin after listening to Legend. I found the likeness, striking. I'm not trying to say he is as great, yet, but he has the potential.\n",

After listening once, I tried to listen again and found myself at Half Priced Books where my $10 investment became .75 cents. At least the McDonald's coffee was good. The songs were smooth. Smooth as in flat, without interest or color. Were the words introspective and deeply meaningful?

The hardest part was finding the stud in the wall.Con:Only complain I have its the design of the TV mount leaves little space behind the TV. Not a big problem, just make sure to plug in your power cord and other cable before mounting the TV to the wall.\n",

IT tilts down so I can watch TV from my Bed and can be adjusted for perfect position. It does not tilt sideways and does not stick out.

The only thing that is bad about that is it can be hard inserting cables to the TV sometimes.\n",

My parents couldn't believe I got a wall-mount for so cheap when they spent about 4 times as much on theirs! For the price, you can't go wrong. It's not the best mount, but it'll do the trick on a budget. I previously bought a more expensive mount from a store which is what holds my 42\" LCD TV in the bedroom, and I will say that mount is better. The tilt feature on that is better, and unlatching it to take it off the wall (if needed) is easier than it is with this one. Tightening the screws at the bottom of this mount at the end of the installation process was kind of a pain.\n",

      "__label__2 TV wall hanger: This bracket is sturdy. I liked the way the TV just hangs up before you tighten all the screws in the lower bracket clips. It takes a lot to lift the 52\" TV the six feet to the mount but if you can do that then you feel confident that it will not fall down. It took three men to lift the TV above the fireplace. It clipped right in and the rest was easy. I liked the way the TV can slide on the bracket from side to side and tilt to where you like it best.\n",
      "__label__2 Very pleased: I have a 50 inch Panasonic and the mount worked perfectly. Easy to install and they provide screws for all surfaces you would mount to.

I can't understand why someone would pay hundreds of dollars for the SAME thing you can get online for a fraction of the cost. The quality of the mount is great and the mounting is extremely easy. Don't waste your money paying someone to mount your flat screen TV. Do it yourself and save a ton of money. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "__label__2 Holding a 65\" plasma well: I bought this to mount our TV and it is working well. The only improvement I'd like to see is for screw holes closer to the middle, so that you can bolt through 3 sets of studs (left, center, and right) when mounting this to the wall...I added the holes to secure to the center stud myself. The level included with the kit...wasn't - but I don't count that as a big negative, as I would expect to have a good quality level myself for a job like this.\n",

The soundtrack is jam packed with glam classics from Brian Eno, T Rex, Roxy Music, PULP, Lou Reed, Venus in Furs etc. Granted that the album is full of priceless glam classics it is not the COMPLETE SOUNDTRACK. I noticed that there are songs that are missing, for example there are two Brian Eno songs featured in the movie that where not in the soundtrack, amoungst others. Speaking of missing songs, it wouldn't have botherd me a bit if they left out the songs coverd by Ewam Mcgregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I can't believe they where allowed to tarnished an Eno number, and T.V Eye! Their vocals are pathetic! But what redeems the album is the PULP song, and the other glam classics.

The only good songs are Virgina Plain and Satelite of Love and Camel in the eye but those are the original songs and i have those songs allready. The songs of Venus and Furs dispointed me it seem Thom was trying to sound like Bryan Ferry on them it would have been better if he just used his own voice. If you want a good glam rock soundtrack may i suggest Hedwig and The Angry inch most of the songs are sung by one singer who has a better voice then most of the rock singers out today. That soundtrack acutally does not sound like a soundtrack which i think is best i am not a big fan of various artist cds. I ended up selling it for more then i paid for it.\n",

During my hunt, I killed a large 10 point buck with a bow and used the Yukon Game Gamble to hang the animal from a rafter in a barn in order to field dress and process the animal. This item was so easy to use and will allow one person to manage hanging an animal that weighed around 160 - 180 lbs with little to no effort. The instructions were very clear and the item works flawlessly. This is definitely an item every hunter needs. I will recommend this to all my hunting buddies and friends. Thanks Yukon.... Rick\n",

There are no serious breaks in the flow and action and the whole meal was over in wink, leaving me still quite bloodthirsty for more. Don't peek at any plot details! The previews reveal too much. I have to say that I figured this one out almost immediately, and I think you will too. But it's wonderfully done from a dramatic and character perspective. I give it only four stars because, to me, the plot has a many holes. Enough to make me uncomfortable, and I'm not the fussy type. Nevertheless, a scrumptious --and very suspenseful-- gobble.\n",

The entire book consists of an endless succession of \"witness interviews\" interspersed with minute descriptions of every meal this \"full bodied\" woman eats. (And she eats constantly!) When the main character tries to act \"cute,\" making what is intended to be humorous observations, she only comes off as irritating.

Most of the scenes just didn't make any sense. The characters weren't likeable at all, I couldn't have cared less if they all got killed. The acting was awful and the script was just down right horrendous. Some of the worst lines came from chris kattan's character like, \"this house is alive, we're all gonna die\" and \"you give me my money right now...I want it, so you give it\". Thats the kind of bad script that I'm talking about. The only slightly decent thing in this movie is some of the special effects.

This was a poor attempt on the writers to make a scary movie out of a nothing plot and it wasn't even that scary. More or less, it was stupid and the idea was very unclear. After watching it, I couldn't tell you what it was about. Well, Actually, it was about a house on haunted hill, but who didn't know that already. 5 people visit it and I bet you can quess what happens from here. They die, amazing. Yeah right. What ever happens to you don't and I mean don't, see this disgrace of a movie.\n",

      "__label__2 Definitely worth a look...at Jeffrey Combs: Jeffrey Combs is underused here (like he is in seemingly every movie that he is in), but Director William Malone utilizes a great score to keeps things moving at a crisp pace, to hide the warts in the plot (like why anyone in their right mind would go downstairs). This is a vast improvement over the stinkeroo of an original. Not real scary, but if they had used more of Jeffrey Combs as the mad doctor, they really could have had something special.Bonus points for the DVD extras, which are excellent. Why would anyone use VHS at this day and age? Go DVD and see this movie in all of its glory.\n",

It's a very nice looking book as well and I particularly like the way his signature is on one of the front pages so you feel as though he has actually signed it for the reader. It's delightful. It is interesting how the reader has the opportunity to 'hear' Michael Jackson's version and intepretation of various events, which is markedly different from the tabloid press and various writers. If you have already read books about Michael Jackson, you will recognise some of the events mentioned in the book. The reader gets an insight into Michael Jackson's interpretation of the world rather than the tabloids' interpretation of Michael Jackson's world.\n",

If you are looking to get a sense of what Michael was like and how he truly was , then read this book. I recommend this book to any MJ fan and also \" The Magic and the Madness \" By J. Randy Taborelli . Michael went through so much when he was alive. It almost sadness me to read all that he had dealt with. He was such a good person. A caring person, a true humantarian.

Before their night of terror is over, the desperate inhabitants will unlock the secrets of the house or suffer the wrath of the demonic evil that haunts the walls of the former insane asylum.House on Haunted Hill is a forgettable movie with laughable performances and a flippin' terrible script.

The author is one of those few people (mostly from the south) who insist that the Civil War wasn't about slavery and he brings this up several times. This detracts from his credibility.

Even after working through the book and tapes I don't feel at all confident in even simple conversation. Coverage of phonics is very skimply and the differences between different phonemes are not explained. The recorded dialogues on the tapes are spoken very fast and are extremely difficult to follow. I feel that the author could have used much more input from would-be users- a book that purports to be a \"teach yourself book\" should be much more self-contained.

I can agree wholeheartedly that his childhood is worse than that of Christina Crawford's 'Mommie Dearest', and that his father will have so much to account for on judgement day for the nightmare he put all of his children through.

Like most guitar players I have spent hours coping Jimis songs. Despite my honest worship of Jimi, much of his live work was many cuts below his studio efforts. He recorded 'live' in an era with poor to non-exsistant monitering systems and played at stage volumes that made recording hit or.

The second track can also be found on the Road Trip Official Sound Track. As for the three live tracks, 'Time Bomb,' 'You,' and 'Place in the Sun,' they are from a broadcast of Rockline in Los Angeles (to the best of my knowledge).

My husband and I also enjoy playing this game. It is well packaged, not in a cardboard box like most games. The directions are pretty good, although we were confused at first about what kind of movements were allowed, but we seemed to get it all figured out. A very calm, fairly fast game. Would be a great game for much older folks, too.\n",
      "__label__1 Poppin' the Hood: I originally heard a cut from this album and thought it would be a great comedy album for my collection. Unfortunately that was the only funny track on this album. It did not measure up to my expectations. Very few tracks are funny and once listened to it is better off filed in the trash.\n",
      "__label__2 Good stuff: I practice kung fu, tai chi, and chi gung. I'm not a Reiki practitioner, but the music is soothing for my meditation and tai chi forms. This particular CD is very good. Every song is almost exactly 5 minutes long. The song changes signal when you should switch to the next Reiki position if you are using it but for me it is good for slow chi gung excercises. Still, it's relaxing music for any situation: the car, the office, etc. I listen to it everywhere and suggest you listen to it, too.\n",
      "__label__2 Not a Textbook: This book is not a regular textbook or even a \"non-traditional\" textbook. It really is just what it claims to be and nothing more: 13 tips on how to improve your Japanese. It is fun and helpful, but it's not a book for total beginners. You need to know some Japanese before it can really work for you.I really likeMaking Sense of Japanese: What the Textbooks Don't Tell You, a nice companion to this book. I own both of these, and I think I got more out of \"Making Sense\" actually. Both books are ABOUT learning Japanese; they're not directly teaching you to speak the language. Just keep that in mind when making your purchase decision.\n",

I have played tons of other Miles' albums on the same system and most of them sound great - especially the Columbia/Sony releases, remastered or not.I strongly recommend the \"Highlights from Plugged Nickel\" instead, unless you don't mind hearing the great(est) Jazz live performance using one ear.\n",

      "__label__1 Maybe Chinese Drywall is Easier to Cut: I've cut narrow strips no problem. No problem, except I have to measure with a tape everytime I change size because the built in rule cuts narrow. I have found anything bigger than 3 inch doesn't cut all the way through. I'm cutting 1/2 inch and have the wheels set all the way in. The u shaped piece of metal bends and I have to use a razor. It makes a nice straight line to cut along though. I guess I should have paid 3 times as much for the American stripper.\n",
      "__label__2 Wonderful Performances: I've been a fan of Ms. Carlson since the mid 70's when she performed locally in rock bands. Her move to jazz standards was the right move (not to knock her ability to rock). This is a wonderful album with strong performances by her and her accompanying musicians. I think it's stronger than her critically acclaimed Christmas albumThis Christmas ... my favorite things. I've listened to this album literally hundreds of times and it still wears very well.\n",

They look the same. I thought Clooney was on Chicago Hope and that was what made him famous. I do think ER is probably one of the finest TV shows ever, so would be curious to see how Hope pans out if it ever comes out. I haven't seen St. Elsewhere yet, and am hesitant to buy the first season the only reason being that if I like it, I would be annoyed if they don't release the following seasons.\n",

I have ridden it for about 6 months now and taken the bike out on a 5 hour trip, as well as short term city biking. Over all it is of excellent quality. Yes there are some problems with this seat. you loose the ability to steer with your legs, and on long bike rides your thighs will be a bit sore.

      "__label__1 I really struggled with the heroine: I finished this book yesterday and even after a day I'm still irritated by the h's attitude. Again considering the time period, I found the h's attitude very 21st century. We are told constantly how 'different' her family is and how her mother just wants her to have a love match. I sincerely doubt that any parent of the day would have gone to such trouble to get their daughter alone with a young, handsome and eligible male.Inevitably the h sleeps with the H but refuses to marry him. Of course the thought of pregnancy never enters her mind (although later it does). The fact that she continually doubted the H's love for her, and he professed it quickly, and if I were him I would have found someone more deserving.I bought the trilogy, which I've put aside for now because I was so put off by Violet. I do like the author though and enjoyed The Temptation trilogy so I'll probably pick up the second book at a later date.\n",

      "__label__2 Would I Measure Up?: This movie had haunted me ever since I first saw it on Los Angeles TV when I was twelve years old. Being the son of a career soldier it was always expected that some day I would serve in the Army. I always wondered whether I would measure up and be able to lead men in combat.In 1991 I found myself leading a team of American soldiers advising an army in a very deadly war against a communist insurgency. Leadership in combat is the ultimate challenge and when my tour ended, I felt no different then how Richard Basehart's character did at the end of this movie.Though a bit dated, this movie is my all time favorite and definitely a keeper.\n",
      "__label__1 A dissappointment!: Frankly I'm quite dissapointed in this film. It's in black and white, which actually is no problem for me since I enjoy classic war films. The dissappointmnet is that the whole movie seems to be shot in a studio!!! and a very small studio! Really dissapointed. Also nothing really special about the story.\n",

It deals with a corporal (Richard Basehart) who has leadership issues, i.e. will he be able to lead if he is put in that situation.

I thought Godzilla becomes evil and devastates Tokyo while fighting monsters that idea is much better than the one in this movie. This is all in a boy's dream...what the heck? Now I enjoy Godzilla movies,I even liked Son of Godzilla but this movie is a disgrace. Why would Minilla be Barney and talk? What's with this bully nonsense? I wanted rubber monsters action, the only good point of this movie is Godzilla verses Gabara that's the only thing that gave this an extra star because everything else is stock footage.\n",
      "__label__1 Oh The Pain!!!!!! Have Mercy!!!!!: Oh my gosh!!!! I have now seen how bad a movie can get! I mean, where's the \"Revenge\" here people?! What was Toho thinking? Minilla talks????? This movie does not have any monsters in it besides the ones in the boy's head. If you want to see a movie with cool monsters you will regret it. Now, if you're looking for the closest thing to Tellatubbies (besides Barney) this is definetly what you're looking for. This is not a Godzilla movie in the slightest.\n",
      "__label__1 Godzilla as, Barney?: Well, almost. This movie is definitly geared towards younger audiences. Most of the fight scenes are stock footage from other films, the plot is kiddy and the dubbing is worse then usual. There are two reasons to get this movie. One, if you are a Godzilla fan and want to introduce your children to the series, this is a good way to do it. This is a great way to spend some quality time with your child and maybe pass on some of what you like about the Godzilla series. The other reason? If your a collector or completionist, buy the video, watch it once and bury it on a deep shelf. Every self proclaimed Godzilla fan should have to watch this video once. It reminds us that Godzilla is for all ages. And it shows that maybe the American Godzilla wasn't that bad. After all, it could have been based on this.\n",
      "__label__2 A Stunning SciFi Action Novel !!!!!: Rarely does a book come my way that I actually cant wait to see the outcome of. Crossworld is one of those rare and compelling stories that anybody with an open mind will enjoy.The story itself is top notch with hints of The Matrix and Blade scattered throughout. Robert Aldrich continually keeps things at a fast and enjoyable pace without sacrificing genious storytelling and immersive detail. Just wait until you witness the awesome hardcore action sequences which are beautifully crafted in every chapter.I fully recommend this adventure tale to anyone with a love of science fiction, anime, fantasy, and breathtaking action. I am eagerly awaiting the following volumes.\n",
      "__label__2 Keep out a picker, but not a kicker: We still use these around the house at all entrance doors. They grasp under the door knob and plant a rubber footer on the floor. If the floor is smooth, like tile or vinyl, the footer and the floor need to be kept clean; otherwise it can slip when forced. I tried getting in once while the thing was in place and I could not do it until I really forced it for a while. I'm a big guy, but I think anyone could get past it if they were determined. Therefore, we use it as a way to keep lock pickers out, and we don't expect it to prevent someone from kicking in the door. There are other devices for that purpose, for people who live in those areas where burglaries are committed by serious career criminals. The only thing we get around here might be the wayward teen who might take something if it's easy. So, I cannot give it 5 stars; it will not keep out someone who is determined to get in. Otherwise, it is sturdy and easy to use.\n",

We live in a rental apartment and I am very scared to have people break into my home while my husband is off truck driving. First off, it is very sturdy \"looking\" but my 1 year old son was able to dislodge it from the door with little effort. My husband was also able to \"break into\" the door after losing his key to the garage by simple pushing the door back and forth twice to dislodge the device. It is good if you are paraoid but know that it doesn't really help prevent a break in, but it will buy a few seconds and alarm me to an intruder.\n",

Wheeler's text simply demonstrates the need for a Frank Netter of sorts- someone who can do for Oral Anatomy what Dr. Netter did for Gross Anatomy. I'm actually considering writing my own text one day so that future students will be able to spend more time focusing on anatomy rather than the minutia and distractions that this book is full of.

Also, there are great versions of Battle Ships, Master Mind, Connect Four, Yahtzee and Chutes and Ladders--all disquised by easily identified title variations. A fun game called Placer Racer is a family favorite.

I love this series because they are a are fun to do, combining dance, yoga, weights, and Pilates to give you a challenging full body workout that doesn't stress out your body. These tapes are set up so that if you don't have a lot of time to workout, you can just do one section and you will still sweat.

I thought that this could be a good product for that purpose, until I used it. This product could not record properly from analog input. It's even much much worse than recording using laptop's analog input. Not only the recording level was so low, but also the recorded mp3 or wma had so much artificial noise that it was unusable. I used USB2 connection all the time. It seems to me that USB2 doesn't help any better.Playing digital music was relatively OK, except that it produced slight background white noise. Still directly connecting from my laptop to the speaker produced much better result.I wonder what the purpose of this device might be ?Not recommended.\n",

There are some real heavy hitters in the cast.Billy Bob Thornton has the capacity to make any film a classic when directed properly. Although, he had his moments in this one.Susan Sarandon was probably not right for the part...OR...was right for the part if the film was executed correctly. She is a gifted and elegant actress who can make a role striking and memorable. This role was beneath her to say the least.Seann William Scott is a modern comedy genuis. He has the look, the resume and the chops to take a movie to the next level. He was also probably not right for this role. He belongs in Hollywood blockbusters, not forgettable films like Mr. Woodcock.Three terrific actors combined into one film should have been a winner but just couldn't do it. Three strikes.\n",

In fact, I'm certain that if anyone with lesser Hollywood standing had been in this it would never have been made.Other than a couple of funny lines delivered by supporting actor Ethan Supplee, there was nothing to laugh at. It's \"Bad Santa\" Thornton watered down to the least, while everyone else on screen is wooden and bland, in a movie so predictable that I have a hard time believing it was even written.Here's the deal: Small town boy makes good, goes home for accolades, meets mothers new boyfriend, hates mothers new boyfriend, decides he's being selfish and works to get them back together.I don't recommend buying it, I don't recommend renting it. If you're bedridden when it comes on TBS at 8am and the batteries in your remote are dead, that should be your only excuse for watching it.\n",

I think this makes the hat look weird and disproportioned. I do wish the ears were more forward; the ears are centered on the hat, so when wearing it they are back by the crown of his head. it would look cuter to have them more towards his temples to so could see them when looking directly at him.

The Goodlife, based on an actual event, begins with the kidnapping of a chemical company executive and follows the crime over a three day period. The plot unfolds through the points of view of the five main characters, moving the story forward, from different directions, to it's completion. This is a very complex, yet readable, compelling story. The writing is gritty, riveting and true to life and Mr. Scribner has a real talent for dialogue. The characters are painstakingly drawn and developed and the scenes so vivid they almost jump off the page. A tight, suspenseful, fast-paced page turner. Keith Scribner doesn't disappoint.\n",

But, over the last 2 weeks, the album has really grown on me. \"Nascente\" and \"Sometimes I See\" are just superb, wonderfully arranged, and with great solos.

Numerous candidates for any \"best makeout tunes of all time\" compilations. Even James Taylor's blessings to validate the safety factor of this project.

I have never enjoyed reading about the American Civil War, however, the author was able to capture my attention in this book.

I was excited about finding a collection of her best hits. I didn't need all 8 records again, just my favorite ones. They were all here on this one long playing CD!! Life is good, when you can put on a CD and relive those 60s, 70s and your youth!! Now, I want to find the Monkees. Oh joy!\n",

Using two large 20 qrt stock pots and a cast iron skillet, cooked a large batch of shrimp and grits with the Camp Chef. For starters, it took me no more than a few minutues to set it up and then I was cooking. Loved it. Set up, ease of use, results all fantastic. Can't wait to use it for future large gatherings. Very sold and sturdy. I can tell it will serve me well for years to come.\n",
      "__label__2 Good steady pace: This workout does incorporate some cardio segments, which are not too complicated choreography wise, but the main focus is the upper and lower body workout. The compound movements (e.g., dips from the step with biceps, leg presses with delts) are challenging without making you anaerobic. The length (50 minutes) is good for a mid-week workout. Is it the most challenging weight workout? No, for those, get the Jari Love DVDs. But is it a good weight workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser? Yes, if you're happy not being sore the next day. Stephanie is a good cuer and leader; her voice is well modulated, and not too peppy. You will need an incline box (I would recommend the transfirmer over the incline box), and 5-12 pound dumbbells. Why not 5 stars? The ab work. As in the other Firm workouts that do the ab work on the incline, unless you have a death grip on the step, you will slide down. This makes them very awkward to do, even with a mat on the incline.\n",

Herzog fails to credibly deal with the relevant NT textual matter not to mention addressing and genuinely interacting with scholarship that finds much more to the historical Jesus than Herzog's unplatable academic gruel indicates.

There was no real heat between the main characters, they seemed to seek each other out for warmth and comfort not because they truly cared about each other, which is OK, I guess, if you're into that sort of thing. Some of the scenes in the book were brutal, like the West is (was) back then. But the characters seemed to hold back their emotions from everyone, including us.\n",

I really wanted to like this movie, but didnt. As a movie, it just falls short. The characters needed a bit more development and the casting was just not as good as it could have been. Kristen Dunst does a good job - but really the movie (and story) is bizarre, so even her acting couldnt pull this movie out.\n",

It never did. I have Amazon Prime so I'm not out any money, but I did waste my time.\n",

His character should have been interesting. Instead I found it so boring that it was impossible for me to believe in Dunst's devotion to him. As a result I didn't care about any of the characters. I found the movie long, boring, and disjointed.\n",

The scanner tends to scan images a bit dark, but that is easily corrected with the included imaging software (I actually use PaintShop Pro to adjust the brightness). The OCR (OmniPage LE)does a fairly good job, but free OCR software will never be the match of $100.00 programs. I scan images almost exclusively for posting to websites. The scans are fairly quick, even with the 30-second warm-up for the first scan. You get quite a bit of bundled software, some of which is redundant (how many graphics programs do you really need?). I use the copy utility much more than I thought I ever would. I even put a shortcut of the Copier on the desktop so I can copy quickly. In short, this is a pretty good scanner with some decent included software and a great USB interface!\n",

      "__label__2 Spirtitual Inadequacy and Redemption: I really enjoyed Strout's earlier novel, AMY AND ISABELLE, so when this book came out (seven years later!), I was willing to give it a read, sight unseen.ABIDE WITH ME is a testament to Strout's skills. She manages to get an avowed secular humanist (me!) to dive deeply into this portrait of a Congregational minister and father who is in deep mourning for his wife. Feeling that his travails are minor compared to the losses that others throughout history have faced, he starts to lose faith in himself. Eventually, his daughters and congregation also begin to lose their faith in him as well.Although the book deals with inner turmoil, there is a lot of dryly spun New England humor in it as well, a leavening that makes for a very satisfying prose mixture. I just hope that I don't have to wait another seven years for Strout's next gem of a novel.\n",

He then goes on to bore us about his take on the O.J. Simpson murder case (as if this has anything to do with the Peterson case-don't ask.) He rambles on and on about his theories on both of these cases, but his theories are based on speculation, rumors, etc. The fact the title of the book is \"Laci Peterson: The Whole Story\" is a joke...the book ends even before the trial. He is supposedly going to write a second book to finish where the first book ended...boy, that's one book I won't be buying.

There were so many stories about himself, that I found myself skipping through the book, just trying to find content about the actual case. I finally said enough, and put it away for good.

      "__label__1 Could of been great: The first seven pages of this book made me believe it would be a real page turner. After that things went amiss. You never really discover what motivated certain main characters to behave the way they did, or why. You also never find out what happened to certain characters, they are just dropped. I also expected a book that involved werewolves throughout, although that too left me disappointed. The worst of it was all the type o's I found. It got to the point where I just wanted to start circleing them out of frustration. I could go on but then I would give away the entire story line and if any one is still interested in reading this book that would be unfair.\n",

Such is the case with Richard Leefs novel, a tale of brotherly competition gone bad illuminated by the supernatural. When a down-on-his-luck photographer accidentally shoots photos of a murder, he becomes the target for supernatural vengeancecor was he the target to begin with? The werewolf is perhaps one of those classic monsters most rich with symbolic possibilities, and Lee employs here an interesting conceit. When horror works, it not only scares us, it illuminates something dark in all of us. We look forward to more from this writer\n",

It may make you feel better however, because it says its ok to feel guilty. In the end - the book did little for me.\n",

It did not.Trying to line everything up, pushing, etc was difficult.

The box overall is somewhat flimsy and can easily be twisted and bent (it feels like thin leather wrapped over a cardboard body frame).The latch sticks, so it doesn't operate smoothly or easily and the lid doesn't open quite enough to balance properly so it sometimes falls closed by itself.On the plus side, the interior pockets and features are nicely appointed in cushy-soft velvet and the watch holders fit my watches nicely and snugly.I had thought that at this median price the build quality and fit/finish would be better. It is disappointing enough that I will probably buy something else.\n",

I am a police officer in Alaska and items like these are a necessity due to the weather. However, I was only able to wear these on shift 3 times before the rubber bands broke. I'm quite disappointed in the lack of quality, not the performance. The materials they use are cheap... some rubber and thin metal wire. The unit cost to make these I bet are in the 25-50 cent range and they charge somewhere near $15! I would gladly pay $15 all day long if the product had good durability.\n",

Clearing off snow can get very challenging with slippery winter weather. The Yaktrax walkers worked great the first time. The second time I used them, they also fell off a couple times. The third time I used them the \"sturdy outerband\" broke.

They are easy to slip on over my riding boots, and I feel secure enough to fetch the horse from the paddock, as well as make trips between my car and the barn. When I am done, I can slip the YakTrax off, rinse them off when I clean my boots, and they are ready for the next use.

Rapaille comes across as an elitist who's tricked everyone into believing he's a guru.

The same is true here. Rapaille's conclusions are ambiguous and unproveable, and you or I could spout the same arbitrary theories. For example, because Americans consume a lot of hamburgers, I hereby declare that the culture code for America is a cow. See? It's easy. This type of random link between unrelated things (and the unsupportable claim that they're not random and they ARE related)is what you get with this book.

It was nice to see when contemporary America at the time had these slight aberrations of slight deviant behavior simmering underneath the country, questioning decency and morals in society, right before the 60's counter-culture was about to emerge. Overall, a great cast, decent script and cinematography (capturing the look and feel of the 1950's), and the beautiful Gretchen Mol capturing the look and spirit of the queen of the golden age of pin-up girls.\n",

The book is better organized than many books on model ship building, but does not cover complete construction from start to finish, instead pinpointing specific areas of difficulty you are likely to encounter with a variety of models and kits. The book has several lists of tools and equipment for establishing beginner, intermediate, and advanced workspaces and also provides directions for designing several specialty tools that are quite useful. The illustrations throughout are very detailed.\n",
      "__label__2 Just Love It!: I purchased a lamp exacty like this from a local store about 5 years ago. I used it in my office. A few months ago my husband decided the floor lamp in the mudroom outside his \"newly remodeled mancave\" was no longer suitable so I offered up my Accord Floor Lamp--of course he accepted. I have been searching all over for a second one for my office--imagine my surprise to find it on Amazon. I really love this lamp because it doesn't take up much space, it's a perfect height next to my desk, each lamp swivals and it has two levels of brightness. Plus it's sturdy enough to stand without toppling when the cat leaps across the room and hits it but it's light enough for me to pickup and move.I'm considering replacing the guest bedroom floor lamp with one of these.\n",
      "__label__2 Cut Quality Rivals Forrest Chopmaster: I have had this blade installed on my Bosch GCM12SD for about a month and am very happy with it. My previous blade was the Forrest Chopmaster, which is out being sharpened. The Chopmaster is an excellent blade but it's typically $30-$40 more expensive than this Freud. The quality of the cuts I get from this Freud is essentially the same as I got from the Forrest blade when it was new (and sharp). The sawn face of the wood is very smooth -- almost polished-looking -- and requires minimal sanding. If I didn't already own the Forrest blade, I would order a second Freud to have on hand when this one needs to be sharpened! Great blade at a great price.\n",
      "__label__2 Nice to see some spirituality: Was wonderful to see the characters depend on spirituality for a foundation in life. It clearly illustrated the conflict, the decisions and the conclusions. The thoughts of the characters made it easier for the reader to relate to a sadly popular occurance between couples. The relationship between the children and their spirituality was also evident when the idea of religon was introduced during a time of crisis. All the while, encouraging a family unit as well as independent growth.The plot was intriguing and kept the reader guessing as to which one was the main topic. Definately a summer read!The only way to improve this book would be to offer a little bit more history about the supporting characters. Although it may not contribute to the plot, it would help give a more rounded picture of the group of friends. This may help other use this book as an example of a support group and may provide a shimmer of guidance and hope to those in such a situation.\n",
      "__label__1 not the best episode: The world adventure teams Dora with Swiper--that's right, as friends. Their mission is to save \"Friendship Day\" by replacing the bracelets that Swiper had swiped. It is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn't visit ANY country where Spanish is spoken. And what's more, the plot is really boring. Nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid. The songs that Swiper and Dora sing together are LOUSY. Nothing about the songs is catchy or fun.Another odd thing is that Dora's voice is different. It sounds like they couldn't get the same actress they normally use to do Dora's voice. Dora sounds older.There are a lot of fun Dora videos out there but this isn't one of them.\n",

I used it while sleeping, and loved it when I first bought it. But, here we are 6 weeks later, and the pillow is leaking air at an increasing rate. The nozzle looks fine, so maybe it leaks along a seam. I'm extra bummed, because it is made in USA, and I always expect good quality from us.

It seems a great surprise to many that he was also the inspiration for waves of British performers who covered his songs: The Stones, Cream, Led Zep, Eric Clapton, etc., etc.So it's particularly interesting to listen to this disc and hear the power of the original - and remastered to offer sound quality which far exceeds my old scratched records.A definite buy for anyone who loves the blues.\n",
      "__label__2 I like it.: I'm giving this CD five stars out of five, and here's why. First off, I like how Chevelle stuck to their style with this album instead of changing it up like most bands do with their sophmore albums (if anyone has listened to Jimmy Eat World's new album, you'll know what I'm talking about.) I also like how the sound transitions from heavy to smoothe throughout the songs. Some bands have trouble pulling off those types of transitions, but I think Chevelle did a good job of it on this album. I was already a Chevelle fan after their first CD, and this CD does nothing to hurt that status.\n",

      "__label__1 Just wasn't good: Having bought this book based on the review above, i wanted to like this book but it was in no way a page turner. I forced myself to read it and found most of it vapid and inconsequential. There really is no plot so much as conveyances of saratoga scenery from one sex scene to another. I found myself skipping entire chapters and not being lost in the \"plot\" because of it which says to me that much of the writing was just filler. Many of the characters actions and reactions to different situations just didn't ring true and then of a sudden the book just kind of ends. It sounds like i'm being uncommonly harsh but having just finished two historical page turners in a row my disappointment with this book grows. I only give it the second star because i actually finished it.\n",

It worked great, but when it developed a pinhole in the bottom, right in the center, and oil started to seep out onto the hot burner, we got weary. And then when it started a small fire on the burner, we threw it out. We'll be replacing it with a stainless steel model (which means it will have to be a different brand).\n",

      "__label__1 Whirly Pop could be so much better: We received a Whirley Pop as a Christmas gift, and love it, but the construction is very cheap. As a previous reviewer wrote - because the pot is so thin, it deforms after some use. This item would get a 4 if the pot were made of better materials - 5 if the lid would clip on and off a bit easier. A shame since the popcorn is so good!\n",
      "__label__1 Broke after first use!: The first time I was making popcorn the plastic gear on the top completely shredded when turning the handle to keep from burning-yeah it burnt! Couldn't turn and threw away the popcorn and the popper! Should've lasted longer, it would've been a nice popper.\n",
      "__label__1 Shoddy and unsafe: I bought 2 poppers, one for myself and one for a gift. I used mine about 3 times and noticed that one of the little wooden knobs had fallen off. I searched for 10 minutes and found one sharp screw pin in my popcorn. I never found the other pin so maybe we ate it. I sent both back as I dont want my granddaughter to swallow a metal pin. I was so dissappointed since now I have to come up with another gift at the last minute.\n",
      "__label__1 BIASED REVIEWS: I was interested in purchasing this popcorn maker as part of a gift set. However, when reading the reviews on Amazon.com I realized a serious problem. The reviews are biased. Look through the 79+ reviews. You'll see the majority of the reviews give the product a full 5 stars (which is extremely surprising considering most reviewers are finicky), are written in the same tone/style of writing, and say what a wonderful gift this would make. Many also mention that it's the best popcorn ever and they've used it for several years. Some even venture to say it only works well only if you use Wabash popcorn.If you read reviews less than 5 stars you'll see all writers say this gadget broke/melted within a couple months. There is a serious bias in these reviews and I hope consumers are not being taken advantage of. Some of the high reviews may be valid but I'm quite certain nearly all are false...I've decided not to purchase the item.\n",
      "__label__1 Construction could be a LOT better.....: The Whirley-Pop model we bought is different from the one shown---the gears are PLASTIC--bad idea #1--and the handle is plastic and set very close to the pot...bad idea #2.The lid stayed on for the first 2-3 uses, then just failed. It's almost impossible to handle piping-hot oil and attempt to keep the lid on. I consider it a definite hazard. The handle on our model is built so that one's hand is directly over the stove burner. Add attempts at controlling the entire contraption with oven mitts and you have a recipe for disaster. I'm too afraid to wrestle with it again--I'm afraid I'll burn myself.Which is a shame, because the popper really makes excellent popcorn. I'd buy another one if it were better-constructed and had METAL GEARS.\n",
      "__label__1 Don't buy this piece of ####: It was a great idea, it's a shame a good company didn't make it, can't even blame it on foreigners. This piece of crap is a rip off. I did't know you could make a pot out of tin foil, calling it flimsy would be a compliment. As soon as you assemble it and turn the handle once to see how it works, you've made a dimple in the bottom of the pot and best of all you can press it back into shape with your fingernail and no effort. The plastic gearing for the turning handle might last 4 or 5 uses. The only thing that was well made was the wooden handle. I guess they were out of balsa wood that day.DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Save your money for good popcorn at the theatre.\n",
      "__label__2 Way better than microwave popcorn: The WhirleyPop makes great tasting popcorn, really quickly. It's not much more trouble than microwave popcorn in about the same amount of time, and the results are *far* superior to microwave. It's also a lot of fun to use!\n",
      "__label__1 not sturdy enough: The plastic gears on these poppers do not grip to the metal post/crank and slip. Any resistance results in the user turning the handle but no movement within the popper. Worked great for first year of average or less use but now, pretty intermittant and a really, more pain than worth. I only continue to use it to keep oil buildup off of other pans. We shake, not crank, now. Won't buy another as it's unfortunately yet another disposable product that overloads landfills.\n",
      "__label__2 Even works will cooking spray! Toasts other items (inca corn): I really love this thing. Someone was giving one away, and I was surprised to see it on amazon! I love mine. I actually gave away my microwave popcorn popper because I ave this. I feel better eating something not microwaved, and it is just as fast! I toasted that inca corn with it. It came out great! Much lower in calories than if I fried it like the packet said. I dont even pour oil, I just use oil spray (try a misto! That would be best). When you pop with no oil, just spray a little oil spray on the popcorn afterward, to make salt stick.\n",
      "__label__2 Good Eatin'!: I love this popper!! It is a fun and easy way to have a healthy and delicious snack. I purchased it two years ago and have eaten microwave popcorn only ONCE since then. Yuck! Once you prepare your popcorn with the Whirley-Popper, you will not want another bag of nuked popcorn ever again.\n",
      "__label__1 Something is wrong here: I agree with a previous review---something about the accolades is biased here (consider the repeating phrases).This does not produce great popcorn. I bought the unit with the special Wabash popcorn pouches touted to have won awards. I have used several, and the popcorn is not crisp, but is chewy, not particularly special in flavor, and full of saturated fat because of the coconut oil blend in the pouches.The unit is flimsy, prone to bending, and IMO does not produce popcorn as good as Popsecret Homestyle or Orville's Movie Theater microwave popcorn.Avoid this item! Within weeks I had to dispose of it.\n",
      "__label__2 Best popcorn: This makes the best popcorn I've had and with only a teaspoon or so of oil.I have used mine for about 10 years but I think it is time for it to be replaced. It only has one small dent and a nice \"patina\" on the inside but the gears are finally giving out. I have a new one that I had bought for gift-giving purposes but I think it will be staying with me while the old one is \"retired.\"I have more than gotten mine money's worth although now I am spoiled and won't eat microwave popcorn any more.\n",
      "__label__1 WhirlyPop popper is kinda cheezy: Inexpensive, but IMO pretty poorly constructed. The idea is good (pop all the kernels --- and it does that) but it is poorly put together with barely marginal parts that slip and so ultimately we just tossed it and went back to the old pot. Cannot recommend to buy.\n",
      "__label__2 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper: Product works fine although it looks fragile, pay attention to instructions, use med-high heat for popping and turn crank slowly, great with white pop corn as well as yellow. Easy clean up.Would not recommend theater type popcorn initially supplieds\n",

      "__label__1 Gear mechanism broke after about 5 uses.: This popper made terrific tasting popcorn, but the turning gearmechanism on the top of the pan is made of plastic, and broke afterI used the pan about 5 times. The pan heats up very hot, and theplatic is a poor choice to use in the turning mechanism.They should of used metal.\n",
      "__label__2 Remind me of my childhood!: I gave this to my 76 year old grandmother for a gift because she can not use the microwave due to a pacemaker. She loved it and is always making popcorn now. The popcorn that came with it was the best popcorn we ever tasted. The only problem she has is that it is hard to use when she is having problems with her hands. She says \"I love it no matter if my hand hurts!\" LOL\n",
      "__label__2 best popcorn popper ever: I have used several poppers, auto, air etc.. This is the best! Yes, you have to stand over it for 3 to 4 minutes but it pops almost every kernel. I have used the cheapest corn and the best-same results. You have to follow the instructions otherwise you will writing a negative review. It works as designed! I would buy this again or as a gift for anybody!\n",
      "__label__2 Great Product!: This is the one I had originally for over a year till it fell off the top of the fridge and the lid broke. Very sad for us because we love popcorn! I tried a different version of a different brand from Fleet Farm and that one was terrible! Whirley-Pop is the way to go!\n",

      "__label__2 Study-worthy.: I found this in an effort to lead a Women's study on women in ministry. I had dug long and hard to find a concise review of various impacting Christian-women's tales all in one place. It is hard to find Christian women biographies - esp of Living women. I appreciate the author's research (and that she narrowed to 12 women, when she interviewed many more).Each chapter is a very brief overview of each woman, but it shows us Christian women who are all over world and most are still ALIVE! In our study, we've noticed how powerfully God uses women - in many different ways, in all countries. Each woman in book seems to start small, ask God for guidance, then He helps them see more of His Big vision and we see how they act on it.Not amazingly written, and each bio may bring up more questions than it answers, but it's a start for world-perspective on being a Christian.\n",

I immediately felt I was listening to a more intimate conversation with the Keepers of the Akashic. While some books try to explain how to access information from the Akashic, Lumari speaks about the collective itself. In this way, I could feel the energies of the Collective and how they perceive the universe and how they gather the information of life. I felt like I was invited into the Akashic - to listen, to learn and to understand.This book is very interesting and opens a whole new conversation that brought deeper meaning and possibility into my own awareness.

At 24 days, I was still removing at least 10 fleas from my dog, per day - the same as before I started using Flea Away. I can't believe that 6 more days would have made any difference. And although the many high-dose B vitamins in the tablets are water soluble (i.e., if the dog gets more than she needs, her body will get rid of it without toxicity), the Vitamin E is not water soluble. Vitamin E can increase bleeding risk and I was a bit worried about my little dog receiving too much of this vitamin. I stopped the pills at 24 days with no relief in sight.\n",

I regret that 1602 is not part of that ouvre.If you're a dedicated fan of the X-Men, Nick Fury, Drs. Strange and Doom, the Fantastic Four, and Marvel's other standards, you may well enjoy seeing them all transplanted into the early seventeenth century. I'm afraid that I outgrew my interest in those characters some time back. For me, this looked less like an exploration of the comic medium and more like a mechanical attempt to inject novelty into franchises that desperately need it.If the usual Marvel crowd holds your attention, then go ahead, enjoy. You'll probably find a lot to like here. My interests have moved on.//wiredweird\n",

If you are either of these things, this is a no-brainer purchase. But even if you are a casual comic fan or simply a fan of good stories, this will be an excellent read and well worth the cover price.It would be difficult to review specifics without ruining something. Suffice to say, some of the best moments come from what would be considered normal events in the Marvel universe and how they are interpreted for the 17th century. I should also mention the artwork is incredible and on par with current comic masterpieces.

The author, who lived in Angola for several years, did a good job of explaining the history of Angola and its people from the first contact with the Portuguese up until the independence. The book explains many of the conflicts Angola has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of colonialism, ethnolinguistic clashes, and the conflict of African and european nationalisms. A good resource for information on how the April 25 Movement in Portugal related to the independence of Angola.\n",

I realize many think the book is an unfair jab at his family, but speaking from an objective standpoint, the book is damn funny.

He correctly identifies the struggles and interchanges that take place in a fundamentalist Christian home overseas. I do not think I have read a more accurate depiction of being thirteen, in a missionary family, in Italy, and in love. It was a great read.\n",

Expect to see this book as a prop in bookcases at discount furniture stores and in new model homes.If you happen to see the movie it's obvious the screenwriter(s) didn't think much of it either. The plot is similar to the book in only the broadest sense.The author probably doesn't care how his novel was adapted, for the popularity of the movie has likely attracted more suckers like me to buy the book.\n",
      "__label__1 Platinum Disappointment: Up in the Air is perhaps the best written awful book I've ever read. Walter Kirn assembles words well, and he's an astute observer of some aspects of frequent traveling. But the story never reaches a comfortable cruising altitude. There's nothing likeable about Ryan Bingham, his seatmates, the woman he occasionally sleeps with, or the family he grew up with. The several weak plots badly woven throughout the book made me feel like I was sitting on a plane, overhearing parts of several conversations, none of which I cared about. As it droned on like the engine of a 767, it was clear the book had no flight plan.A few pages of this sad, cynical tale might have made a good essay; maybe a few pages more could have been spun into a readable short story. But a novel it's not. And the tired little book certainly isn't worthy of all the publicity it's receiving.\n",

The following chapters address la formacion verbal, la formacion nominal y adjetival, formacion pronomial, el lexico: diferencias semanticas, tiempos verbales, y los modos verbales: indicativo y subjuntivo. Whether you're a seasoned veteran with Spanish, or still learning, this book is the best on the market regardless of it being older than a few others. The one drawback is that it does NOT use international phonetic symbols, but anyone with some light familiarity with the international symbols will be able to crack this book in no time.\n",

I don't know whether his vocals have improved or if he has just learned to sing slightly different to match the change in pitch. In my opinion this album as a whole, contains his best music in twenty years. None of the songs stand-out above the rest, but they are all solid. His past 5-6 studio albums contain 1-2 great songs surrounded by very bland ones. Recent albums may have had good lyrics, but the music doesn't stand up to the standards Merle has set in the past. \"Chicago Wind\" is an surprisingly wonderful exception to this.It is a shame that most C&W; radio stations will never play any songs that make their listeners think about political, social, economic or environmental issues.\n",

SURPRISE! It wasn't the hardware, it was the CD. I own thousands of CDs and have never, ever heard a recording this poorly engineered and presented. That sent me back to listen to the Amazon samples.

Honestly you have to go into this movie with an open mind and free time because it's slower paced. Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting was really phenomenal and passionate as well.

The movie attempts to create an engaging storyline that leaves the viewer disgruntled and confused.

The essence of the book, a deep and evocative exploration of a father and son relationship, is beautifully captured in the film. The premise, a cross country trip to deliver the National Tree to the President's lawn is well rendered; Andrew McCarthy and Andrew Williams do a superb job. But in an hour and a half, the quirkiness and delight of the novel could not be completely explored.

As far as the recipes go, it is great- they have different ice cream bases, and suggest in each recipe which base works best for flavor. They also have recipes for sorbets, toppings (fudge, caramel, etc), and other desserts that can be used as add ins (brownies, blondies, etc). It also, obviously, doesn't talk about frozen yogurt.

      "__label__1 Poor: Having used Mavis Beacon 8 long ago I wanted a refresher... This program is really not well designed--the biggest problem is each exercise only features a line or two of the appropriate new symbols/keys and then you are typing all the letters you know--sometimes even ones you haven't been taught yet--so it's difficult to solidify the finger positioning of new keys and gets confusing. Really not well thought out. There are enough advanced features that an experienced typist can increase their speed or a child COULD learn on it... but MB is so much better. Someone claiming to go from 20 to 54 wpm in a week is either an experienced typist that was rusty or lying (then 103 wpm. Sure).\n",

As far as I know it is legal to make a backup copy of original tapes that you own, for your own personal use under the \"fair use\" provision, just as you can make an archival copy of computer software, as long as it is for your own use, and not to sell etc. The only reason I gave this thing 2 stars is that it might prove useful for transferring home videos to DVD although I have not tried that yet.\n",

Don't let the interesting song titles fool you, this is a must have.\n",
      "__label__2 Since Otar Left: This touching film speaks to the irrational ties of familial loyalty that even a lifetime of hurt won't extinguish. With warmth and subtlety, it details how the younger generation of women protect the health and well-being of the eldest through the kindest of deceptions. Though consumed by long-simmering resentment over Eka's favoritism toward her only son, Marina still makes an unselfish choice to shield Eka from hurt .\"Otar\" is a life-affirming gem, with all three actresses superb in the central roles, particularly Gorintin, who broke my heart as Eka.\n",

Ever since my boys were born (they are now 14 and 11), I've been searching bookstores for \"The Three Investigators\" and always told they were out of print. Finally, my kids have the chance to read something exciting that demonstrates the power of logic and critical examination to solve a problem. Everything winds up having a logical, real-world explanation; none of this \"x-file\" mystery junk that has no bearing on reality. And done by characters that are believable and all children can relate to! I re-read this book numerous times in my childhood, and hope my children will enjoy it as much as I did.

Duh. They weren't in a package when they arrived. They were made in Mexico. They may be former Epson cartridges that have been refilled. I haven't tried them yet.

      "__label__2 Different Battles is a fascinating read.: Different Battles is a truly unusual book. It's a meticulously researched, vividly imagined historical study. But it's also a moving personal memoir--all the more powerful for being understated. On top of all that, it's a fascinating read.The author grew up in Vero Beach, Florida during World War II when German subs were a greater threat along the U.S. East coast than most people realized. The boy's father, Kit Johnson, uses his fishing boat to search for and rescue the survivors of ships torpedoed by the Germans. He later fights a very \"different battle\" with Alzheimer's. Peter Cremer, the charismatic and somewhat enigmatic Commander of a German U-boat, captures the reader's imagination.

It's an inspiration to re-examine our own lives to see the how we can unite our sufferings with the Lord and allow Christ to work through us. It also reinforces the message of God's Divine Mercy and God's desire to shower us with His mercy when many may think we do not derserve it or even want it. While we can never merit God's mercy, He truly was working through St. Faustina to spread his message that he wants to give his Mercy to all who accept Him and to the whole world which is in so desperate need of Mercy.

If you want his best work, buy his spanish albums -- Amazon has all of them (kudos). He somehow loses the passion and energy on this album. If you like latin-influenced pop music, watered down for an American audience that is too narrow minded to listen to lyrics in other languages, then you will like this album and the other \"latin craze\" music (Martin, Iglesias, Lopez). Latin music has been around forever; it is a shame that Americans think it is now \"the rage\" because a few English albums with latin beats have been released.

While longtime fans wont find much of the salsa here that they've always known him for, there's still plenty of continuity in the fact that he's as fine a singer as ever and a sure romantic.Then again, Marc Anthony has always been about putting his own spin on his roots, so would-be critics should be warned--he wont be tied down. The single I Need to Know, with its pulsing salsa horns and piano, was a ubiquitous item on mainstream radio that clearly rode the fast waters of the Latin floodgate opened by Ricky Martin (Anthony used to sing back up to Menudo)and others.Thats Okay delves a bit deeper into the clave, while the plaintive How Could I combines the fluid fire of Spanish guitar with soft, slow-jam programming. A sweet pop nugget, You Sang to Me offers soaring waves of keyboard as Anthony makes his amorous declarations with breathy urgency.Sexy, salsa king rides the crossover wave.\n",

      "__label__1 Awful!!!: Thank goodness I rented this movie before actually buying it. It wasn't even funny at all. I am greatly disappointed and thought it was going to be good! The creators really missed a lot of opportunities to make a fantastic movie!\n",
      "__label__2 figured it would suck but it didn't!: after seeing the trailers on tv for this (quite a while ago!) I figured it would be a cheesy movie with a few one liners - boy was I wrong! it surprised me from the beginning and I can still laugh while thinking of a few parts of it now! I don't even like Cameron Diaz but in this she does GREAT!not one for kids though! I still won't let mine watch but I'm strict like that.\n",
      "__label__1 terrible.: 1st off, Cameron Diaz was grossly miscast in this role. There were probably dozens of actresses who could have played this role better (how does she keep getting job after job after job?? She's an AWFUL actress - at best).Now i like funny and sexy as much as anyone. But these \"jokes\" were just downright crude and not even a little bit funny. This makes the Seth Rogen-type comedies look like Gone With the Wind.Although all the roles were bad, Justin Timberlake did the best job in his, rising slightly above the rest of the pig slop, proving he was actually too good to lend his name to this trash.Its lucky to get a one-star rating here, as you can't dish out zero stars. Avoid at all costs.\n",

      "__label__1 2 Minute trailer far better than the entire film!: I had been wanting to see this movie since I saw the previews - since seeing it, I could have just as well stuck with the previews. It was as if someone filmed short clips and stuck them together - there were many parts of the film that did not transition very well, and there was very little chemistry between the actors in the movie. To keep this short, I will not be watching this movie again.\n",
      "__label__1 Bad Teacher = Bad Movie: I just finished watching this really bad movie and thought I'd jump over to Amazon and see what others thought of it. Not surprised that there are more 1 star ratings for this than 4 stars. Can't believe C Diaz actually read the script before shooting this and still continued. Her career is really in a tailspin after this kind of crap. There's the good part of Hollywood, and then there's this. If Amazon had a way to award 1/2 star that's what it's worth. Maybe not even that much. What's next for Diaz... a TV sitcom? Wouldn't be surprised.\n",
      "__label__2 surprisingly funny: Yes this movie is raunchy and over the top, but I loved it. There are awkward parts and it is R rated for a reason, but this is the best comedy I've seen all year. Don't take it seriously and you'll love it!\n",
      "__label__2 A pleasant surprise.: A reluctant teacher loses her wealthy fiancé' and thus has to return to the job she hates. Desiring breast implants, she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores. Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film. This is a movie that I found funny and refreshing, in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout. This is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator. A pleasant surprise.\n",
      "__label__1 The reviews are correct; this movie stinks: 1. This is one of those movies where you think, wonder, perhaps hope that all of the negative review are wrong... because there are well know actors in this film. But this film proves again and again that famous actors + lousy writing = lousy movie.2. Please save yourself some time and money, pass on this complete dud.\n",
      "__label__1 \"Bad\" is accurate for this stinker: This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thankfully I am just out the cost for rental and didn't buy the DVD or see it in the theater. Rather than come up with any remotely funny dialogue, the writers just pile on f-bombs, or worse. The only reason I watched to the end was to see how much worse it could continue to get. The great Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal are totally wasted. The gorg Cameron Diaz should fire her agent. Do yourself a favor and run away from this humorless turd.\n",
      "__label__1 Bad? More like terrible...: There was nothing fun or funny about this movie (I knew the reviews weren't good, but I thought there had to be at least some enjoyable parts -- I was wrong). There was no chemistry between Cameron and the PE teacher. I couldn't tell if Justin T's character was that ridiculous or if it was just really poor acting. There were zero likeable characters and no character development. From watching the movie, I had no understanding as to why the main character was so nasty to everyone. Did something happen to her as a child? A little background would be nice. Overall, pointless.\n",
      "__label__1 bad teacher: BAD is right!!! After the first half hour had to turn it off. Life is way to short. I wouldn't waste your money on buying it. Rent it first if at all.\n",
      "__label__1 Should be rated X: First of all, to anyone that thinks this movie is supposed to be deep, realistic and taken seriously; don't. I don't believe it was meant to be taken seriously, however it's still not funny. Yea, it has a few giggle moments here & there but most of the scenes made no sense. Weak Plot. Too many scenes that tried too hard. It wasn't necessarily boring but simply not funny.The dry humping scene was extra, totally unnecessary. The teachers other than Cameron Diaz were torture to watch. Seems like a lot of things were just thrown together at the last minute from the producer.I recommend ages 18 & older only to watch, anyone younger is just inappropriate. It suits young adults who need a brainless movie to watch while high on marijuana.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointing: I couldn't muster enough faith in the story to prod any longer than page 41. I found it difficult to relate to, sympathize with, or even respect the characters. They were intolerable, existing only to drive the plot. The book professes to extol the principles of cultural tolerance and individual sensitivity, but it fails in this as it attempts to bridge ethnic, gender, racial, economic, generational, and, especially, the individual divide.The characters are pigeonholed in stereotyped behavior, manner, and thought. A stilted performance of a highly advertised and acclaimed book.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointing - Anne Tyler Seems to Have Lost Her Joy: I was most disappointed with this new book from Anne Tyler. And I would agree with some of the other reviewers who think she's lost her special gift. Her characters have lost their endearing quirky edge and their sense of humor. (Who can ever forget the man who washed his dress shirts at the end of his day by stomping around on them while taking a shower? Or the family that always put the groceries away in exact alphabetical order. I could go on an on.) In her last few books, however,her characters have pretty much fallen flat. I fear that this change to more serious, humorless stories is a relection of her own life. It seems that since her husband died, her stories have suffered. I hope she will rediscover her old witty, truly joyful view of life and bring us back some of her mesmerizing quirky characters. I await her next book with great hope.\n",
      "__label__2 Good book: Digging to America by Anne Tyler is a most enjoyable read. Our book club is usually into heavy stuff, and it was delightful to read something that wasn't a \"downer.\"Anne Tyler writes simply and directly. She can capture a scene and emotion with few, articulate, well chosen words. I laughed out loud at the binky party.The main character is really Maryam who is searching for \"belonging\" as is almost everybody else in the book.You'll enjoy this book, It's not a GREAT book, but one that can generate some good discussion.\n",
      "__label__1 Boring: I have to rank this with the top ten most boring books I have ever read. It's my first Anne Tyler book and there would have to be a pretty good argument for picking up another of her books. The characters in this book were so uninteresting. I couldn't connect with one character. Practically the whole book is about planning a party or attending a party. After the first party I pretty much decided that attending a party with these people would be torture! The underlying themes had the promise of making this an explosive book, but they were just left dead on the pages while the characters and parties bored me to tears.\n",
      "__label__1 Great writer, but surprisingly dull and uninvolving book: I've read every Anne Tyler book and usually enjoy them and always find them readable.But this one (I haven't finished it yet) isn't very compelling. A week or more goes by before I pick it up and I think I'm just going to have to set aside a few hours and \"get it out of the way\" which is a horrible thing to say about a writer I enjoy so much.Neither the characters nor the plot are compelling to me -- just seems like dinners and lunches at one anothers homes. The characters--her strong point--seem flat and without a strong plot to move things along...it just ain't moving along.\n",
      "__label__1 Characters In Search of a Plot: As an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction about the transracial adoptive experience, I was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this book. However, I was disappointed and surprised at how the author failed to create momentum or at the very least, a forward moving plot. Much description was given with no action, mainly reading like the background biographies of the characters rather than details that are integrated into a developed story. Most distressing is the lack of three dimensionality to the children themselves, a list of physical attributes and behavioral tics do not make them come alive. I am a true sucker for any kind of family formed by adoption story, let alone one with the outlines of this book as it mirrors my own family, but the fact that I didn't feel moved at all signals to me, an unconvincing and inauthentic rendition of this experience.\n",
      "__label__2 Romance & Politics: The Devil's Paw, a novel of espionage and intrigue during World War I, is very dated in light of subsequent historical events, but it is facinating nonetheless. There is a moderate amount of suspense and action from the main characters, but the thrust of the novel is a study of the political climate of England at that time. Julian Orden, son of a British aristocrat and vocal espouser of the Socialist cause attends a dinner party and meets Catherine, a young woman of mixed antecedents--British and Russian. In her face he recognizes the person who saved his life on the beach the night before. These two characters become caught up in a plan by the leaders of the working people of Germany and England to force a premature end to World War I. I enjoyed this book, but unless you are interested in the philosophy of British politics and the position of Socialism in that era, I would suggest another choice.\n",

      "__label__1 Biased writer: This book was required for one of my courses while earning my teacher certification. I noticed that the author works at my university so I'm not too surprised that it was required and not just recommended. The author, Mark Ryan, is very biased in his view of education. To him there is no place in a classroom for traditional teaching styles. It should be an open, student-directed learning environment where the teacher is a \"guide on the side\". My 8th grade daughter is suffering through this type of teaching right now and I can tell you that leaning too much one way or the other isn't good. When will the education community learn to use a little bit of all types of teaching philosophies rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water?If required to read this text, do so with a grain of salt.

      "__label__1 I didn't love it.: This story of Grace O'Rourke and Rathe Bragg was my second-least favorite book of the very talented Brenda Joyce. The absolute worst was Runaway Bride, which I didn't bother to finish after just a few chapters.This book was very unsatisfying and highly predictable. While Rathe was somewhat interesting, Grace was very stereotypical and cliche, in my opinion. Most of Joyce's fans look to her to really make the pages sizzle with passionate heat, and sadly, this book fell short and it fell HARD. None of the love scenes were endearing or worthwhile. Is this the same author that wrote The Fires of Paradise?On a more positive note, Joyce's use of the deep south during the horrible aftermath of slavery was a very promising backdrop for an excellent story. The plot did not stand up to the setting, and the \"romance\" between the main characters was dry and inspired very little emotion from the reader. If you love stories set in the deep south, you may be able to find some enjoyment out of it.\n",

This book touched me as it was a combination of Ms. Vanzant's personal anguish, trial and tribulations as well as her own victories coupled with the thought-provoking inspiration for which she is famous. INTERIORS is a story of one woman's personal journey through some of life's darkest valleys and in facing these demons, she rises like a phoenix into the realm of self-actualization, self-love and most importantly, self-respect.Although INTERIORS is an autobiographical journey of Iylanla Vanzant's life, it can be applicable to anyone who has experienced pain in their own life.

The fold-down wheels at the feet just look silly. His telescoping sword is a cheap cop-out for a weapon, along with his spoiler supposedly doubling as a shield. The grey plastic looks horribly dull.

While it is easy to put together and provides easy access to all items with a revolving top, the design is poor and does not handle much weight. One of the legs broke away under stress after a month of use, and because of the design, is all but unrepairable without adding unsightly screws or straps for support. The legs have notches which slide in to grooves in the bottom of the center pole, and the notch on the leg is thin and easily breaks away. Also, the base of the coat tree is too narrow which causes it to topple over if the weight is unevenly distributed. I attempted to use it with 1 winter coat, 2 jackets, a full length dress coat, and 2 hooded sweatshirts, and ended up having to redistribute the items often.\n",

I suggest Donald Michael Kraig's superb \"Modern Magick\" if the GD tradition appeals. At least Kraig's book gets to the heart of the WHOLE POINT for doing it in the first place, unlike this volume, which only discusses it in scared little whispers.Magic has moved on, and it's time that fact was recognised once and for all.So... don't buy this book, unless you like the picture on the cover.\n",

The picture qyality is acceptable on full screen (17\") but excellent in a 5\" by 5\" window. Sound quality, very good.

To work the sides of my neck, I placed one ball on a tailor's ham (used in sewing) so that my shoulder would have room while laying on my side with the ball fully supporting the side of my neck.

      "__label__1 This music requires an almost supernatural technique...: Composer Godowsky has beautifully augmented the Etudes of Chopin, adding textures and even extra melody lines, with just two hands expected to somehow play it all. Carlo Grante is a very good pianist, but this music requires amazing dexterity. This is a noble attempt, but too often Grante is forced to break the rhythm and fluidity of the pieces in order to accomodate the extra material. Many of the pieces are simply played too slowly. Imagine Chopin etudes plodding like dinosaurs, like someone's got a thumb on the record! Marc-Andre Hamelin has the supernatural technique to play these pieces well. Grante plays some of the studies well enough. It's interesting to hear him attempt some of the most complex pieces ever written. But perhaps he needs another few years of practice. Someone wrote that Grante has re-recorded these pieces for release this year. It should be VERY interesting to see what eight extra years of practice has yielded!\n",
      "__label__1 Nonsense.: Grante has no idea at all of style appropriate to this idiom. Most of these are unrecognizable. No sense of texture, tone, legato, or anything else that would have meant anything to Godowsky. Check out Godowsky's American records, e.g. the Berceuse, (not the Columbias) to hear what I mean. As bad as I've heard since Szidon's hysterical Scriabin or Pollini's brutal Chopin. No bueno. Really no stars at all.\n",
      "__label__2 Good place to start: Although a bit outdated (especially s far as examples and tables are concerned) this book is still a good starting point for those who wants to begin with their research in astro economics and astro trading: for example, if you have never read an Ephemeris table before then section two of the book will explain you how to do it. One important point: this book makes reference to moving planets \"aspects\" and their correlation with turning points in the market: it has little to do with financial astrology , here you will not find corporations' horoscopes, first trade dates or stuff like that. Another observation: this books is very simple to understand: the author writes about astronomical cycles without mentioning equations, signals theory and celestial mechanics concepts, great for beginners, maybe this a limit for those more into this subject.\n",

      "__label__1 Technical Errors: There are so many books 'how-to' books out there on mosaic technique. Some are accurate, clearly based on extensive practical knowledge and experience, and some have very misleading and incorrect information. I'm afraid this book falls in the former category. When an author mentions using Elmers craft glue to create a mosaic or seal a substrate, then I would hesitate to trust any of the other information in the book.For a proven 'how-to' book on creating mosaics, I would suggest 'Mosaic Techinques and Traditions' by Sonia King or any of the books by Emma Biggs, Tessa Hunkin, or Elaine Goodwin. These are all working mosaic artists and instructors and the techniques they share can be counted on to provide you with a solid foundation in this wonderful art form.\n",
      "__label__2 Great calming liquid: I got a rescue dog and for the first few days he was very difficult. When I left he would bark and howl for hours. My rescue contact suggested that I try Good Boy. After one day of adding it to his water, he became totally different. Slept like a baby while I was gone and when I got home was back to normal. It seemed like I was drugging him b/c it was so effective. But he is very normal and active whenever I was around. Odd. After a few days I decided to stop putting it in his water b/c I was worried that it was too much. But after that, he just stayed calm all the time. I think it helped him make the transition to being in a new house with a new owner. Ever since then, he has been just fine and not hyper active anymore. It really saved the day for me! (and him...)

This Album is a great master piece and has the collaboration of such great composers as the argentine composer Bebu Silvetti and His Mexican compatriot The master of such hits as \"It's impossible\", \"Adore\", and \"Yesterday I heard the rain\", the legendary Armando Manzanero. This album celebrates love and not sexuality. The songs that stand out in this album are \"Sol arena y mar\", \"o tu y ninguna\", \"Quiero\" Dimelo en un Beso\" and \"Tu solo Tu.\" This album is a combination of pop/Jazz/ballad/classical woven together.

The second generation Decoding Society, guitarist Cary DeNegris, bassist Reginald Washington, violinist Akbar Ali and saxaphonist Eric Person on this recording persons in conjunction with African singers/percussionists Twins Seven Seven. The result of the collaboration, while interesting, lacks much of the fire that the older Decoding Society had.By and large the pieces are invested in funky African rhythms, they have a nice sound, the playing is good all around (particularly Washington, who adds a good slap funk sensibility and slithers nicely between Jackson's rhythms), but there's by and large something really quite unfulfilling about the record.

I haven't even finnished and already three other people are in line to read it. It's great for anyone in the arts business or anyone even thinking of becoming an actor, it paints a picture of what actors go through, the ups and downs.

      "__label__1 WanderLOST: A lot of books seem to be taking the approach this one does in terms of writing - completing the whole story in the form of e-mail correspondence between the main characters. While it was a novel approach at first, it has started to wear thin and I kind of wish writers wouldn't use it so frequently. In nay case, this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted (emails only) and it's hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it. The central plot was a romance, a triangle romance, where the heroine is caught between 2 lovers. It wasn't a really good book and I wouldn't recommend it. The characters were not very interesting and the exploits of the main character were not as adventurous as the title and preview made it seem. I think the story would have actually worked much better if it had written in a traditional format.\n",

      "__label__1 Big letdown: Like several other people have commented, I purchased this book based on the excellent reviews. It is a decent story at best. Several things need to be said: it is NOT, by any stretch of the imagination, scary. There are several creepy sequences, but that is it; NOT horror. Second, the book does essentially NOTHING - a very slow, boring, tedious, and pointless \"build\" - until the last 100 pages (out of 480 is ridiculous). It really isn't building much. It could have been said easily in 150 pages vs 380. All-in-all, I would chalk this up to a bunch of people reviewing being a little downsy, as well as ridiculous. Anyone that says this is \"scary!\" or \"terrifying!\" shouldn't read horror novels whatsoever. I've read my share of horror fiction, and this is easily the worst and least scary.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointed: I have to admit that I was very disappointed with the novel after reading the glowing reviews. This book was probably one of two books I have never finished. I just could not bring myself to complete it. I honestly found no character that pulled me in emotionally. Everyone seemed to be caricatures of one fault or another, including the father and daughter. In all honesty, my opinion of almost every book or movie rests with the abilty to care about at least one character. In this book, I found no one. I was turned off by every person in the story. And as for the chills, I did not see what the other reviewers saw.I have never been one to put someone off of something. But this time I just had to write something down. Judging by all of the other reviews, I am in the extreme minority. I may give another of Tamara Thorne's novels a try. It may have just been this particular book.\n",

      "__label__2 A Wiersbe classic that all should read: Christianity is a relationship between God and each believer, with Jesus being the mediator (First Timothy 2:5). That relationship sometimes breaks down because we frail humans always want to take the easy way out. The easy way out is to make rules about how we should live, such as \"never drink alcohol\" and \"never go to movies.\" Wiersbe explains why rules like those are detrimental to a believer's growth. He explains in simple but precise ways that the Law of Moses was intended to cause each of us to realize two things: (1) we cannot please God by following the Law because we can't follow the Law (2)and the Law was designed to teach us that we need a savior from the Law. That savior is none other than Jesus, the mediator between a holy God and unholy mankind. Wiersbe's book is simply a great book. Read it and Be Free!\n",

To my knowledge the new James Bond Series does it most...and best. However there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed..sadly 12 rounds is one of them. The moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action, or an actual by stander to it..and does work sometimes. The problem with 12 rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film. This film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie. Instead of feeling like you are at the scene of the action, the busy camera is distracting and diminishes from what might have been a better film in the hands of a more competent director....and Mr. Cena..doesn't help..he's not the greatest lead...and needs better support in front of and behind the camera if he is going to shine.\n",

The main character, the faithful monk Tenzin, is very likable, and your heart goes out to him when he expresses doubt that he is up to the task of finding his teacher's new incarnation. There is a scene where he revisits his late teacher's now-abandoned and ruined retreat home, and he is overwhelmed with sorrow and begins to cry. Depictions like that abound in this film - moments of touching human-ness that make you realize that people are the same all over the world. There are also moments of joy, like the scene where Tenzin and his reincarnated master, now a very young boy, are both trying as fast as they can to make bottles of soda pop foam up and spill out over the glass.

The desriptions of everything from the lawn to the moonight were ridculously lengthy and the dialogue throughout was unrealistic and misguided.

In comparison to \"Ticktock\" or \"Watchers\" or a host of others, this one is a real sleeper. Sometimes I scan a chapter and see nothing, then go back to read it in detail and find the same.

She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old.

I bought the book and my mother and I have both just finished reading it. What an unforgettable story - and what a strong and courageous woman is Sala! Thank you, Ann, for bringing this to the rest of the world and for all the incredible extra research you have done to fill in the spaces. It is the story of a life that is much too important to be kept in a box. My husband will read this beautifully and lovingly written book next and I have recommended it to my book club. Thank you!

After hunting for security products on my computer that would have modifiend the files to make it think it needs to be installed again I found none. Tech support was useless (the usual reponses, \"are you logged on as and administrator\", etc.) as they didn't really read my email about the problem and just sent \"cut-and-paste\" responses to general computer problems.

It also has a neat feature: it will accept 2 DVI inputs from 2 computers and then allows you to toggle between computers with a button on the front panel. Sadly, this feature stopped working after roughly 8 months of use.When I called HP to claim a warranty repair, I was transferred to a service agent in another country. After 20 minutes of repeating and correcting serial numbers/model numbers I was told that this monitor was not in their database and therefore I could not be helped. What the heck! I offered to email pictures of the model number sticker, fax copies of the invoice, etc. All to no avail, the \"service\" representative declined my request to speak with a manager to resolve the issue. So I guess I'm just stuck with a half-broken product.In the end, it's still a nice monitor, but I'm frustrated with the lack of customer service.\n",

He said they might just be selling out what they had and there would be no more.

Needless to say I played the game for nearly a week before giving up completely.The idea behind it is great. An MMORPG that doesn't revolve around killing endless amounts of rats and pigs to level up. It promoted party-based adventuring to the extreme. The modules/quests were self-contained. Everything seems just great.But the execution for this game is extremely poor. The quests just aren't much fun. The combat system is ok. The way leveling is done doesn't make much sense, especially for a game based on D&D.;I dunno, I found this game extremely boring (even for an MMORPG). This game was my second time trying games in the MMORPG genre, and it'll definitely be my last...Don't waste your money.\n",

The latter was true, but the more I got into this book, the more I actively disliked the main character, Alma. A growing dislike of the character made it hard to plow through this long and overly detailed book. The author, in my opinion, wasted my time on needless, and seemingly endless details that added nothing to the story for me but pages, time, and effort.Though the book apparently appeals to some, it was an experience in reading drudgery for me.

They do have temporary effects, but do not last long. This book also was not the execption. There are many \"Things To Do\" which I should do right now to change my life. But I don't and can't do these \"Things\". Always when I read such kind of books, I am firm about trying to do these \"Things\".

It is even worse with flash, the camera takes too long to come back after taking a flash photo--so if you want a so-so camera that operates well, you can get this---or you can get that anywhere...it's all about what you need this camera for.

I was directed to purchase this book by a professor who was a student of Layton. I wanted to better understand the gnostic traditions and this book works to explain the gnostic mind in mind-numbing detail. The western, Enlightenment conditioned mind will not easily understand these scriptures because they don't exist in the rubric of rationalism. They are mythology. The gnostic scriptures are more like reading Hesiod's Theogony or Ovid's Metamorphoses than the New Testament. If your goal is to truly understand gnosticism Layton is indespensible. However, if all you want is a general understanding of gnostics, avoid this book. It will only muddy the water. You have been warned.\n",

      "__label__1 Fear-Mongering and Inaccuracy are the real agenda here: I was unfortunate enough to come across this book at a local used book store and since it was dirt cheap, I decided to read it because I was curious. What I found was absolute drivel. Its anti-gay rhetoric is designed to reinforce negative attitudes toward homosexuals, which it accomplishes vie generalizing, stereotyping, and the presentation of purely inaccurate information. Those who are already militantly anti-gay will find what they're looking for (lies to back them up) and those who are not will alternate between horror and laughter at what this book tries to do.\n",
      "__label__1 Scare them into Heaven: I have read many commentaries on homosexuals and the church. This book dehumanizes the homosexual community. It tells lies about the homosexual community and it keeps homophobia going. This gives the people the Right to go kill or threaten homosexual people.If you read through church history and even read the Bible for what it is there is nothing in there about homosexual acts. I believe the best book out there that best tackles this topic called \"Dirt, Greed and Sex\" by William L. Countryman.For those that read the book and stated that they are scared of what \"agenda\" the homosexual community has, its beyond me. People do not do enough research and/or reading.

For instance, no mention is given of the fact that a homosexual co-founded the modern conservative movement along with William Buckley, or converted the civil rights movement to non-violence--Bayard Rustin, and organized the famous March on Washington where Martin Luther King gave his famous \"I have a Dream\" speech. The authors seemed to come to the topic with their conclusion in hand and sensationalized some fairly boring situations to make their point. There are better books on this topic.\n",
      "__label__1 Typical Alarmist Drivel: The authors' claims are unsubstantiated, with flawed reasoning and research. They are deliberately negative so as to further their own agenda of hate and intolerance. It is one thing to believe your god says it is wrong, it is another to deliberately and maliciously twist the facts of something so it fits what you want to believe. The former is merely a difference of opinion. The latter is downright dishonest.The glbt only want the same rights accorded everyone else. No more, no less.\n",

Again given the price this is to be expected. The paper towels themselves are fair to poor in absorbancy thus my lower rating.

      "__label__2 Just as great as the rest.: My package came very quickly and was in perfect condition when I got it. Big Bang is hilarious and I will be watching these episodes over and over again! The ultraviolet digital copy is really weird because you cannot actually download the episodes and do what you want with them. You download them to an ultraviolet client and watch them within the client.\n",
      "__label__2 Still great: While the previous season was simply fantastic, season 5 is almost as good. It does somewhat lack some of the more hysterical pieces in last season but overall it is the funniest show on tv or DVD at the moment.\n",

      "__label__1 less than OK: The show itself is wonderful and I have been watching it in order from start to finish. My DVR didn't record this particular show and I could not figure out any other way to watch it right away. So given all that I was on the desperate side. The quality was not good. I got the story line, but the quality was \"jerky\" and fuzzy. I hope I never need to watch any more episodes this way.\n",

      "__label__1 Good Theory, Vague and Outdated Code: This book is a good start for those who want to work on the guts of their own mud. The target audience seems to be accomplished C++ programmers. The author assumes a great deal of expertise on the part of the reader; I for one was left in the dark on many topics.The code examples on the companion CD are not fully explained in the book, and I found several code snippets in the source files that had no mention at all in the relevant chapters. The code examples also will not compile on newer versions of GCC without a great deal of work.This book is a good intro to network programming, and does a good job of outlining what is needed to design and code a MUD from scratch, but I would stay away if you are not already an accomplished programmer.\n",

      "__label__2 Excellent book for elementary age children!: I am a School Psychologist and Mobile Therapist and this book has come in handy on many occasions. I work frequently with students who have been diagnosed with Autism, and I have found that this is one book that students really enjoy. There are great pictures and stories that my students love to see and read. We typically act the stories out afterward either in person or with dolls/action figures. No matter how resistant the students are to the rest of the activities, they typically consider this a rewarding experience. I would recommend it to all school staff and parents who deal with students that are lacking social skills in some way.\n",
      "__label__2 The best book for teaching social skills and I've used several!: I bought this book to help teach my 4 year old with Aspergers about how to deal with social situations. The book uses real photos of children in various situations to teach the right way to do something, like stand in line, and also shows a photo with the wrong way. It explicitly teaches, among other things, how to approach other children to play, how to ask a teacher for help, and how to have a conversation. My son loves reading the book together and I can already see him implementing the lessons after just a few weeks. For visual, step-by-step learners, this book is perfect. I own at least 6 books on teaching social skills and this is by far the best and most effective one I've used.\n",

Hard to find this type of container at retail stores......\n",
      "__label__2 Best Shape for Me: These 7-sided pill keepers (my family calls them \"pill wheels\" but you'll never find them that way on Google) are, in my experience, the best shape for this sort of thing. Round ones cannot be set up on their edge, and the \"stick\" style, with all the days in a horizontal row, don't tuck as discreetly into a purse or pocket.It's hard to find these in stores. This is a great price and I'll order several.Note: if you can't easily distinguish which are your morning pills and which are your evening, you'd best buy two of these and load them accordingly.\n",

I unfortunatley did not read reviews nor did I realize that this was coming from the UK, nor did I realize that the shipping costs were astronomical (almost more than the cost of the three openers.) My order was placed on December 8th and after three days I was notified that I would recieve them by January 7th. Obviously ridiculous and after an email to the seller through Amazon, I was told the openers were on their way and I did, in fact, recieve them after 10 days. I also expected the openers to look like the picture. They did not. It's a plain opener. It does not say Worlds Greatest Bottle Opener. It's plastic. It works, but it's nothing special. Disappointed for sure. I'm usually smarter about my purchases, but have always had good luck with Amazon and just let this one slip by. So...live and learn.\n",

      "__label__2 Incredible layout!!!: I bought this book for my plant biology class. Even though I was required to only study about 3/4 of it, I read the entire thing from cover to cover. If you want to find out about plants and the natural world, take a course with this book or just buy it and read it like a good non-fiction book. The layout and format are very modern and appealing. There are sections on ecology, which are very important in understanding what is happening to our environment right now. Plus, the book doubles as a plant reference/gardening book because it has a monster appendix with stats and care information on tons of common and rare plants you might grow at home.

      "__label__1 Too, too much!: I love old, glamourous things, pieces with history and beauty. There are plenty of them in this book, but as a decorating guide, I found it a little too rich for my taste. Some rooms are over the top, and some, to me, are hideous! But taste is a very individual thing. Rachel Ashwell's Shabby Chic books are more my style, I think.\n",

I agree that it is a wonderful book as the antithesis of potterybarn and restoration hardware living that is enough to kill anyone with an independant idea- and while the author's style is too fussy for me, I love the text and the pace of the book. I would highly recommend it to someone who believes in interior decoration as a theory, a passion, if not a practicality.\n",

It is way, way too overdone for my taste, and in no way does it reflect any element of french style that I've seen. I'd consider myself a francophile, but even Versailles looks restrained in comparison to Strasser's layers upon layers upon layers. I'd hate to clean in any of these rooms. There are some good ideas, like the rinceau treatment of the warehouse room turned parlor, but they were largely hidden under swaths of satin and clutter. I'd hoped for more depictions of true french designs.\n",

      "__label__1 Life imitates art: This book isn't much more than a novelized screenplay -- kind of a \"Cape Fear\" in a political setting -- and I can't recommend it to anyone. But for those questioning its credibility: a state Senate candidate in Tennessee has just been charged with the murder of his opponent, a heavily favored incumbent who was killed on his farm. The parallels pretty much stop there, but it's still eerie.\n",

One was about schools taking out soda machines and putting in water and healthier drinks, but still having McDonald's and Burger King which is even less healthy.Chew on This was not my favorite book. I am a vegetarian so the meat part made me gag. The book takes a long time to read; it feels like forever. The things that I don't like are when they explain how they kill a chicken and that pink lemonade is really made from bugs. I know that the facts are disgusting, but it is awesome how bugs can turn lemonade pink. The purpose of writing the book is to convince the customers not to eat at fast food restaurants. I suggest that you only read this book if you like reading about disgusting things.Adrienne F.Grade 6Ms. Kawatachi\n",
      "__label__1 Not as good as the rest: This compilation, while a decent collection of trance and techno, failed to \"hit the spot\". Unfortunately, the quality seems to be deteriorating. Euphoria II and III were amazing collections. If only they could come back with that same magic.\n",
      "__label__2 Inspiration to begin buying CDs again: Seeing as my CD collection has all but turned into a glorified set of frisbees from the MC hammer craze, I decided to start afresh with Matt Darey's Euphoria Level 4. Although I normally just download the most popular trance and house tunes on MP3, it's the lesser known tracks that fall inbetween that really stand out on a compilation like this. The second CD is my favorite of the two, I recommend tracks 4, 9 and 11 -all of which were discovered while napping on the train to work. I also recommend Darey's Ibiza release within the Euphoria collection.at best: you have a CD with mellow tunes to chill to, and plenty of thumping sets to throw parties withat worst: you'll find a few no-namer DJs with good sound that might be worth checking out on MP3\n",

      "__label__1 Waste of money!: My son saw this advertised on tv and begged for it for Christmas. I looked for it everywhere and finally found one last one on the shelf right before Christmas and thought it was a great score. Wrong! After playing with it for 10 minutes, watching the Alien \"balls\" fizzle like Alka Seltzers til they exposed a couple of cheap, plastic toys, he completely lost interest. The van is poorly constructed and the parts do NOT fit back in, nor does it stay together. Just TRY to store it on a shelf without it falling apart and spilling its contents everywhere. This piece of junk is going right in the give-away bag. And my son won't miss it!\n",
      "__label__1 So NOT worth it: This really ticked me off to find out that I only got one when it clearly says that it's sold as a six pack. If it's possible I want my money back asap. I don't understand why some people are receiving only one and then there are the lucky ones who get all six, something tells me that those reviews are fake.\n",
      "__label__1 Not as advertised: As with many other reviewers of this product, I only got one canvas in the package, not 6. This company either can't count to six, or it has the most expensive single canvas I have ever seen.

They sound completely different and pull it off nicely. Every song is great and sounds completely unique. \"Heart of Hearts\" and \"Maybe Next Time\" are two songs that when you fight with your woman and need to feel even worse about it, you pop them bad boys in and you're good to go. My favorite song on the album is \"Protocol\". It kicks serious donkey. I've had this CD for close to 4 years and it hasn't got old yet. Although it is hard to make out thru all of the scratches and battle scars. And it has one of those f*cking sun spots that looks like a kid stood over it with a magnifying glass and burned a hole thru it. I need to get it again. And again if need be. And yes, even again, after it has been mangled 5 or 6 times, I will still get it again. Well, after two times, I'll probably just steal it off of the internet. Thank God for piracy and plundering swashbucklers.\n",

But something about the book was off for me.It just wasn't that funny.The book is nicely put together, with some footnotes for references to British pop culture, but there were some missing references. The acronym WTLM is used in almost every ad, but is never explained. The ads themselves are creative, but I wouldn't consider most of them humorous. I think this book is best in short doses; if you sat down and tried to read it straight through, as I did, the humor dies almost entirely.2/5.\n",

I was looking forward to listen to her Bach violin concertos. But when I heard them, I was really disappointed. She plays them technically perfect, but this is not what I heard in the music hall. Her violin concertos are not inspiring. They have no soul, no meaning. I wish she played them like she plays the Bach partitas.A dissapointed Dutchmen\n",

If you are looking for a recording of a performer who pays attention to performance practice of baroque era music you will be disappointed. Vibrato is used throughout and the ornamentation leaves something to be desired. All said though, this is a beautiful recording that I enjoy even though I know that it is not as Bach would have wanted it played.\n",
      "__label__1 A Misstep: I have loved every previous Hilary Hahn recording, and given them all 5 stars. This one is a distinct misstep. It is just too fast. I felt like punching my cd player to slow it down! The playing is brittle, lacking in character (except for one of ths slow movements), and wholly without interest. Had I heard this recording blind, I never would have thought this was Hilary Hahn. Such a shame.\n",
      "__label__1 A self-published, 156 page novel: 'nuff said?: The first 5 reviewers here are obviously the best friends of Margaret Doner! This is a skimpy foray into too deep waters for a beginner. Have you ever read a good Tudor biography that was only 156 pages long? Can you imagine that there are any significant facts, details, insights in so few pages? Well, you're right--there aren't! What we do have are stereotypes (dirty old king, lusty Chaucerian wench, stupid courtiers, etc.). What is most egregious is that there is never even an attempt to explain why and how Catherine and her cohorts could have made so many stupid mistakes, how they could behave as if there had never been an Anne Bolyn: that's the mystery that has always fascinated me about Henry's \"rose without thorns,\" but you'll find no answers here. Please save your money, your time, and be a bit more patient. Eventually, someone is going to write a truly good historical novel about Catherine Howard.\n",
      "__label__1 Colored hair a bluish tint: I have used the Crew Classic Gray Shampoo for years. The shampoo in my last bottles is a very deep purple. Over time (about 4 months I would guess)my hair has taken on a bluish tint. The person cutting my hair noticed first (I get my hair cut about once a month). Then my wife noticed. The bluish tint began so slowly, I really didn't notice, much to my chagrin and self admonishment. But, when called to my attention, my hair clearly had the faint bluish tint. I have now changed shampoos after years of Crew use. I suspect it is something in the formula that was changed over the last year or so. I, of course, don't know for sure, but the color of the shampoo and the fact it was first noticed by the person who has been cutting my hair for years, leads me to this conclusion.David T.\n",
      "__label__2 Seek to See Him: It is most probable that the Valentinians, like the Manichaeans and the Naassenes, at least were acquainted with Thomas and incorporated some of its traditions into their works perhaps because it contains a negative world view and stresses \"knowledge\" as part of its soteriological scheme.But gnostic use does not predicate gnostic origins. We should be speaking of an influx of traditions found in Thomas into Gnosticism, not the influx of Gnosticism into Thomas. The future of research on possible connections between the Gospel of Thomas and Gnosticism should be moving in the direction of exploring the influences that this non-gnostic Gospel's ideology may have had on emerging second century gnostic systems.\n",

I am incredibly disappointed that he would include this person on his list of reputable and respected mediums, as this person is merely an actress, nothing more.

He features highlights of experiments with medium Allison DuBois, but Schwartz' bias in favor of his subject matter makes this book an epiphany of self-celebration. There is a fascinating section, The Monty Keen Experiment, and the results seem extremely remarkable -- why isn't it published in Science Magazine? Talk of \"Replication and Extension Reading\" is confined to Mr. Schwartz's \"Lab,\" and we're left wondering if any of Schwartz's experimental designs or raw data are being shared with other universities.

The ideas presented in this book are done so without any regard to scientific method, and \"The Law of Attraction\" is far from a law. Laws are absolute. Laws are proven. Laws are backed up by fact. Show me the proof that our bodies operate at a particular \"vibration\" and it is this vibration that either attracts or repels things in our lives. This book does not offer that proof, and neither can you. Sorry, finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground is not proof that our bodies are \"vibrating\" or that finding that ticket was based on positive thinking.Be careful of any writing that proclaims something a \"Universal Law\" that clearly isn't.Don't get me wrong, I'm a big proponent of positive thinking and I feel it is helpful.

The book goes on to develop techniques to answer the question and implement solutions.

However, extract the music from the movie, and what you have are 10 tracks that all sound about the same. To sum it up in one word...boring.

I do have to say that \"Unchained Melody\" is a stand out on here as every Elvis fan knows that this was close to the end for him, but the voice was stronger than ever.

Very insightful and informative, lots of quotes from drivers, engineers, CEO's and designers too. Many color pictures adds to the enjoyment !\n",

The lid is easy to put on and off and nice and light, although does not blow off in the wind. It holds at least 4 bags of play sand from Home Depot and could easily hold more. It can hold 3 toddlers comfortably and has provided lots of fun so far! The one and only issue is that i often sit on the front claws so i can play with my baby, they have now dented badly...and i am not hugely heavy either! There was no mention of not sitting on it, so i had thought it would be durable enough. This isn't to put anyone off from buying this sandbox..just don't perch on the end of it!\n",

I cannot really remember the film very well, because I was too busy clowning around at the back of the room with a few classmates in order to avoid having to watch it. It just did not capture my interest. Years later, I went online and read about the summary of the book and concluded that I really had not missed out on something that I would regret having missed out on, since it's just another little-guy-against-big-corporation story. I am very sorry if I've offended anybody with my critique of this film, because it is fine with me if you love it; I just did not. Also, I apologize to the makers of this film if I have insulted them, and also to the author who wrote \"Hoot\" if this review has or would offend him. It just didn't interest me, I am verry sorry to say.\n",

Typical Hollywood - put down the father figure at every opportunity.\n",

He was the consummate professional in every aspect. One of his finest qualities was to be tireless, or appear to be while on the job. Working long hours, he never complained about the ridiculous tasks being asked of him and always offering suggestions on how to improve a shot. Every assistant could learn something good from this remarkable person.\n",

It is very impact resistant to the point of being almost indestructible. Once I accidentally hit a support beam/pillar with full force (don't ask -_-) and I found no trace of damage on the bokken. The only flaw I see is that polypropylene is not as dense as wood so the bokken is easily damaged by sharp objects and can be cut by bladed weapons.

      "__label__2 looking for the rest of the book: Broken was a bit of a disappointment. It is a quick read and not a bad book, but I was looking for a little bit more. There are a number of storylines that are introduced throughout the book, but none of them really mature. It left me wanting more, which isn't a problem that I normally have with Ms. Armstrong's books. Even the main storyline, with the portal unleashing a Jack the Ripper-like killer seemed shallow. There is little Pack interaction. The witches are only mentioned. Jamie pops in with a narrative hook, that goes nowhere. The newest vampire seems to be more comic relief than much else.As I'm reading, it occurred to me that the book, just well, seemed tired and other readershave commented that this is the last \"Elena\" book. Evidently, I'm not the only one thinking \"tired\" since there is a teaser for a new series by Armstrong in the back that looks interesting and different. It is about a woman \"completely of this world,\" according to the teaser.\n",
      "__label__1 A mature, immature book: I guess I am the minority with my review. I thought this book was a yawn. Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler's angsty prose. I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point. I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour). I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.All in all, the material is meant for 'mature' readers, but the style is clearly not. A lot of reviewers say that the 'love' between the main character and her brother is just 'beautiful', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings. In my opinion, this book is purely shock value with no substance, so if that is your thing, then go for it.\n",

I was surprised whtne the cardigan went with everything. It is longer than I expected, so it goes well with the tunics that were in style this fall/winter. I also love the detailing of the sleeves, and the little pockets. The material is soft, and has the slightest sheen to it - I can't imagine it becomeing fuzzy or dull anytime soon. What I love most about the cardigan is that it is very versitile - so far I've worn it with tanks and turtlenecks, every color imaginable (I bought it in white). The versatility also means it can go with dressy, business and casual wear - and I've worn all three. It has become a staple in my wardrobe.\n",

Obviously, not a song critic; the author shows no appreciation at all for the lyrics and verse that captured, and still captures the world. The accounts of John Denver's personality were also written as fact instead of the farce that it is. Members of his family, children and ex-wives; continue to praise on camera-his gentleness and giving. This is not the book to read if you want insight into a man who gave the world his genius and his hope for a better world in the only way he knew to share this hope. He was, however, a man and problems he had with alcohol and relationships are outlined in his autobiography...and not very different from the evils many people face from day to day.\n",

She got really depressed because she was in a stuffy hospital and her room was just plain it wasn't different. Which she liked being different from everybody else.

Izzy went on a date with a senior who she didn't really like and then went home with him even though he was drunk. She got in an accident and lost her leg. Abandoned by her \"friends\" she befriended an \"odd\" girl named Rosamunde who she'd never really liked before. Izzy was too absorbed in being liked and \"nice\" and I didn't understand why she would't take a ride home with the guy she had a crush on when he offered. I thought that the Izzy in her head that did cartwheels that she was always mentioning made no sense. I found the parts where Izzy was in the hospital really boring, and her parents bugged me. Instead of being happy that she'd made a friend who visited her and kept her happy, her mom was worried that Rosamunde wasn't Izzy's type. The story had no heart... it didn't make me like the characters, it didn't make me happy, it didn't make me sad, it was just boring.\n",

I would recommend all this book to all teenagers.\n",

Buy it for its really cool ideas on how to write song lyrics (but don't look for music composition in it.) One of the great ideas it has, though, is to write lyrics while listening to one of your favorite song's music.

The replacement Duo has had lid-locking trouble as well, followed by, when 3 months' new, the screw holding the handle onto the pot continually getting loose but becoming stripped so that the pot/handle cannot be repaired. With my repeated calls and emails to Fagor customer service to get the pot repaired or replaced, I was discouraged by their slow and impersonal response; if they replied at all, it was with a cryptic one-line instruction and web-link to watch their long and complicated video on how to repair the pot myself!

I had high hopes because a full third of those pages dealt with Hannibal's boyhood where the author is at full license to use his imagination given the lack of historical detail for Hannibal. But it almost as though Mr Leckie gets bored and rushes through the end in order to begin writing Scipio. Historical inaccuracies aside, the life of Hannibal deserves a better account than the author has attempted and I think it is safe to say that the definitive fictional biography of Hannibal has yet to be written. If you like historical fiction set in the Roman period buy it, if not, don't.\n",

The author mentions on pg 42 that due to space constraints he will list only one lang or the other.

Listing 4.1 gives code to be added to the page_load method. When you try to run it it doesn't work. You find out 3 pages later that you should have added a group of \"using\" statements. It would have been easy to add these lines to the snippet, or at least give a forward reference to them.In the same snippet you're invited to open a database named \"pubs\" (Publications) The following snippets perform various functions on this database.

The final product is sweet and creamy, despite warnings that homemade yogurt cannot rival the texture and consistency of commercial yogurt. Not so in my case.

I read some of the reviews saying that it does not make yogurt like you can buy in the store. To that I say \" you will be enjoying natural yogurt with more nutrition (probiotic). Store-bought yogurt actually defeats the whole purpose of eating yogurt with your meal. You can make store-bought like consistancy if you incorporate little bit of pectine or soluble fibre like agar agar powder.

There are other yogurt makers much cheaper. This item has been discontinued. Usually when a small kitchen appliance is discontinued it goes on clearance. It is important to note that this item does not churn ice cream, and it does not churn or freeze yogurt. This item merely heats to the proper temperature for making yogurt. The sellers who are selling this item are clearly unethical as anyone can see by the price. This is a yogurt maker and should be priced as such.

The Salton yogurt maker is a no-frills, budget appliance; it is not one of those fancy, gourmet Euro-Cuisine or Donvier makers, which come with individual-sized glass jars and cost twice as much as the Salton. No, the Salton YM9 is a plastic, plug-in model, and it does the job FINE. I wanted to make my own yogurt because store-bought yogurt is costly, and, if you read most ingredient labels, is often made with high-fructose corn syrup. I prefer the 1-quart container because I make a big batch of plain yogurt once a week, and then add pureéd frozen fruit and Splenda to flavor it as I desire. It's a healthful breakfast food or snack.

Unfortunately, since those reviews were written, the design must have changed because quart sized mason jars do not fit the yogurt makers that were delivered to me. The glass jars are too narrow and too tall to work well with it. Now, unless I can find a short fat quart jar, I am stuck with the plastic liner that came with the set. Very disappointed. :(\n",

The plastic scoop spoon that comes with the YM9 is unnecessary. I like the 1 quart size rather than hassling with several small containers. Cleanup is a breeze and the YM9 is an attractive appliance. Make sure you have a candy thermometer as you will be preheating milk and mixing starter only after the milk has dropped to the right temperature.

In this bi- and tri-lingual text, he has justified my confidence in him.The poets translated in the volume have a varied amount of \"Indian-ness\" - some speak the Indian language of the group with which they identify, some do not. The poems themselves range from poems that show a non-Spanish aesthetic to those that are openly \"Spanish\" in some sense. For example, a poem by Jaime Luis Huenun is titled \"After Reading So Much Cesar Vallejo\", and three poems of Graciela Huinao remind me of the sparseness of haiku.My favorite of the poets in Elicura Chihuailaf whose poems center around blue - a color with strong ties to the Indian culture. These poems are perhaps the most Indian, but the poems are universal in the depiction of humanity and its relationship to the rest of nature while being accessible and particular in terms of images.These poems are well worth your time.\n",

However, the characters never came to life for me and I found I gave up on caring what happened to them. Further, the \"bad guy\" seriously lacked credibility.

Irving's usual ironic humor is missing, and there doesn't seem to be anything taking it's place.\n",

After the third time I was mentally screaming \"ENOUGH ALREADY. I GET THE PICTURE. 'LUGGAGE' IS OKAY NOW.\" Irving's constant use of italics is also extremely (in italics) helpful. I couldn't have possibly worked out the nuances of the conversation for myself. NOT. Combined with the thin and dreary plot, this work is not exactly a page turner. More of a page churner.\n",

The book started out where a tragedy is announced and I was immediately pulled into the novel and ready for some heartwrenching times.Instead, as the book progressed, I had trouble reading it becuase it seemed like he was just trying to hard or something.If you read Prayer for Owen Meany, then Son of the Circus, then you read this book, you are in for a big disappointment.\n",
      "__label__1 Please don't bother with this one: \"A Widow for One Year\" was my first John Irving book, and it might be my last. While I thought the plot was interesting (at first), it quickly went downhill from there. Irving cluttered up the novel with extempraneous details and subplots that did nothing to help me to the end. If anything, they were deterrents along the way. I didn't love, or even like, any of the characters. And Hannah was a nightmareÑI found myself wondering why Ruth (or anyone) would ever be friends with her. It was such an effort to finish the book that I vow never to force myself to read such drivel again. The only thing that I looked forward to in this book was finishing it so I could start a new oneÑby a different author.But, I hear \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" is well worth the read.

I did not care in the least for Ruth Cole, the main focus of the book, or any of the other drab people we meet along this sad journey. If this is the only John Irving book you have read and you didn't like it - don't do yourself a disservice - please buy and savor his previous fine novels.

Even the \"weakest\" character is so well developed that you love him more for his weaknesses. Also my edition had an interview with the author at the end of the book. It was so enlightening. Read it only after you finish... I have now decided that my next two Irving books will be Garp and Prayer for Owen Meaney. Both these novels have been tranformed to the \"big Screen\". Having seen Cider House on the big screen, I saw all that was missing. I am looking forward to reading these two and rediscovering the world according to Irving.\n",
      "__label__1 I knew it wouldn't be Owen Meany and was STILL disappointed: John Irving seemed to be presenting his story of Ruth Cole as if from a great distance. His narrative seemed often to be building up to something - as if it were all deep background -- that never happened. Astounding coincidences aside, the narrative was so sparse, so clinical (and pretty crude)that it was really difficult to relate to any of the characters. For example, it was hard to imagine why Ruth Cole and Hannah were \"best friends\" as they acted like they only hurt and annoyed each other. They didn't seem to understand or to comfort each other. It was as if Irving said they were best friends, so they were, but there was no reason to believe. I did like the narrative devices that Irving used, including Ruth's postcards and journals as a chapter, and one of her short stories. It enriched what was otherwise a sparse narrative. In all, the first section was the most compelling, the rest... not so much.\n",

However, after the first section, there is nothing that's either interesting, compelling or particularly well written. It's my guess that Mr. Irving started a pretty good novel and either to explain or excuse his purient interest in prostitutes, tried to steer his good opening into a trite story about and unlikeable writer and her purient interest in prostitutes. I guess if nothing else, this book helped Mr. Irving explain to his wife and the IRS why he needed to hang out in Amsterdam's red light district.\n",

No such luck. I was relatively bored by Ruth as a main character. Her raucus friend Hannah seemed more interesting. And- big deal about the older woman, 16 yr. old boy story. Shocking? Not really. If the story was about Eddie's life after this love affair, it would have been much more colorful. Not much room in this book for titilation either, lest a murder get in the way. Yawn. Drawbacks: boring, and slightly interesting from chapter to chapter Positives: At least there was some resolution of conflicts- or hint at it. Loved the ending. Clever final dialogue.\n",
      "__label__1 Such a disappointment: It's hard to believe this is the same author who wrote the extraordinary Cider House Rules. It felt to me like one long (in Irving fashion) rebuttal letter to his critics. This book was transparently Irving's forum for justifying, through character Ruth, his style and choices in past works. If you read the book, you'll understand. Yes, I believe a man can write from a woman's viewpoint. No, I don't believe Irving was able to pull it off in Widow. The book read like a Sidney Sheldon novel. The only difference is that (so far) it's not embarrassing to read a John Irving book on the bus. The story was entirely predictable, the writing simplistic and even dumbed-down and the cliches ran rampant. I was expecting something more heady from one of my favorite American authors.\n",

It's also their best, possibly because they have themselves a fairly new - and extremely talented - bassist in Joe Jones.Distressor is a mix of everything associated with Brit pop with a little punk and heavy rock thrown in for good measure. It's nothing very innovative or particularly new, but it's a very well produced album that is the kind of CD I like to listen to when I write. They're a solid band who deserve to start getting some recognition soon.\n",

      "__label__1 Is Aleister Crowley boring? Is that possible?: It's a shame that this book is so tedious, because the author knows his subject. I read Lawrence Sutin's biography of PK Dick and I was impressed, so I had high hopes for this one. But there's no structure to the story, no plot. Sutin moves from one moment of Crowley's life to the next, never making it clear if he's describing a high point, a low point, a turning point, etc. Halfway through, I promised myself I'd finish the book, sure that as Crowley's life reached the end, Sutin would bring things to a climax. But he didn't. Sutin knows the facts but didn't present them in a compelling way.\n",
      "__label__1 Beginner romance: While Wolf has written other novels that I have enjoyed, this one felt like Introduction to Historical Romance 101. The characters were not in the least complicated, nor was the story line. The language and style felt as if it were intended for a very YOUNG female audience...Nell would be interesting to a sixteen to twenty-one year old reader, but not to one with more mature sensibilities. Even the vocabulary felt simplified. This does not make this a bad book, merely one that I could not recommend to anyone with any understanding of the period, or who wanted a more fully developed love story. It might be a good book to use to introduce your daughter or granddaughter to Historical Romance novels (but I'd prefer something there with more life to it and better characters). The sex scenes are tepid, the characters are one-dimensional, and there is a lot of internal prayer and moralising, if you like that sort of thing.\n",

The Unrepentant, and 15. Christmas In Washington. This 2000 concert presents a striking contrast from Steve Earl's performance in 1986 at the same venue during his \"clean cut\" days. Steve has grown tremendously over the years as both a singer and a song writer. Damn... Steve on mandolin on Copperhead Road is priceless. Love Copperhead Road! This is a must have DVD for Steve Earle fans, and if you happen to have his 1986 performance you will come close to having complete concert footage spanning most of his career. The sound quality and video are satisfactory.\n",
      "__label__2 Helps Maintain Existing Strength: I've been going to the gym for about 5 years pretty consistently now. I try to get there at least 3 times a week, but during the busy holiday months that doesn't always happen. I normally use muscle milk, but decided to give this a try after seeing it. While I didn't really notice too much increase of energy nor gains while using this, I was able to keep my muscle mass and the amount of weight I am pushing at the gym consistent even when only going once or twice a month so I think it works pretty well. So maybe if you use this every day and lift almost every day you would see better gains, but I really just wanted to maintain and it helped me with that so I would use it again.\n",

      "__label__1 Immature, unlikeable main character.: I was excited to read this book because the title indicated that it could be a compelling book. Instead, it was so boiler plate that I knew from almost the outset who was responsible and it was a chore to have to read through it just to find out what I already knew. Also, the characters were just dull or in the case of Meagan, annoying. The entire plot of her involvement in questioning a suspect was unbelievable. Actually, the entire book could have been a high school writing project.\n",
      "__label__1 Somewhat disappointed: After reading the great reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. But I was disappointed. The author's prose was excellent, and the story well conceived. But the only compelling character happens to be the victim, Dr. Diana Duprey, whose story is told through flashbacks. She is a multi-layered and very interesting character. Her husband Frank is bland, and her daughter Megan is a spoiled brat. I wanted to reach out and choke her halfway through the book. The \"romance,\" if you can call it that, between Megan and the detective seemed unnecessary and not believable. I also saw the ending coming a mile away. I kept waiting for a twist at the end, but it didn't come.\n",
      "__label__1 Somewhat Helpful but Disappointing: One of the best things about the book was it mentioning to do the NCAA 101. Unfortunately, you cannot do that in the game! Having the information available about the schools (over half of the book) and their favorite plays was helpful. So was the descriptions of the plays. However, the play images did not include player movement, which is crucial -- there is no excuse to \"save space\" for such crucial information -- one of the big reasons for such books is to be able to carry it and not have to have the game in front of you. The instructions and strategy are good, but not great. Helpful but disappointing.\n",

Of course there is a bit of odor to the fluid, but I personally like it (yeah yeah.. don't say it). I've seen some of these cans leak at the cap when tilted, but mine doesn't. Its simple enough to grab and pour fluid into a Zippo, even being the large 12oz can.I'm not saying anything that others already haven't, so I'll end with this. If you want your Zippo to stay reasonably clean, not stink horribly, and burn consistently... get the Zippo brand. Other brands will work, just not as well.\n",

I've been told by zippo enthusiasts that you can use different fuels in your zippo, but this will always be popular because it has the zippo logo on it. The fuel itself smells exactly like lighter fluid that you put on your grill and comes in a metal canister.*NOTE* When I first got this, I pried the nozzle up and it flung zippo fluid in my EYE. Be careful when opening the container. Also, it comes out very fast and if you're not careful will leak onto things.\n",

The only reason I got that far was that I assumed I was missing something, that surely it must get better. I did not find this game to be challenging at all, it's a matter of reading through page after page of text, clicking on everything in a room to get all the evidence, and presenting everything you've got in court. I see no comparison between this and games where you actually have to solve puzzles, like Myst or the Nancy Drew games.\n",

      "__label__1 Poor Film Making at Its Finest: Bloody awful. Character actions lack motivation, logic, or explanation. Acting is brilliantly mediocre.

It's pretty much a given that gay cinema sucks; this film does nothing to dispel that notion. I thought the directors' other film, \"Shank,\" was dreadful, but this...wow...even worse.\n",

The CD has nothing to do with the used car business; it is a recording of a telephone interview which discusses motivational techniques for all business. The title is less than honest but is only slightly justified by the instruction to go to a certain website for more about the used car business, but that information is kindergarten level stuff which can be obtained free on most any online search engine.

I pretty much don't even read the words but rather am descriptive for my son, I will read it \"when Ernie has to pee-pee or poopie\". I would not recommend this as a real learning experience for your child, but as I said my son does enjoy looking at it.\n",

However, this is pure nostalgia, the flavor and essence of Piaf and her amours [the breathtaking Marcel, cut in his prime] - then Theo.Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker, Jean Marais, Cocteau, Romy Schneider, Alain Delon, Jean Paul Belmondo, etc. we get glimpses of the not so distant past - this is a perfect mood piece, instead of an 'in your face' documentary.A must have for the serious collector.\n",

When Piaf talks, her voice is immediately paved over by the voice of non-actor reading a translation of Piaf's words.Beyond that, it seemed a bit ragtag as a documentary -- some interesting details, but it all feels rather like an inexpensively made TV special that makes do with whatever odds and ends are most readily available.\n",

In this case, the title is totally misleading.With respect to length, the book drones on and on, and took me a surprisingly long time to finish considering the modest number of pages.With respect to being an introduction, the author seems more interested in showing his expertise rather than guiding those new to the subject. He spends a lot of time on esoterica, while failing to clearly present the basics of linguistics.For a truly good introduction, I suggest \"Teach Yourself Linguistics\" by Aitchison, which is well organized, concise, and covers all of the basics.

It's a good thing, because it was replaced by a unit that wouldn't run. I took the fan unit (which wan't damaged) out of the damaged unit and put it in the second unit and it runs, but only at a low fan speed. Anything higher causes too much vibration noise. Also, both units we received were poorly finished, with the base being several shades lighter than the cover, which matches the picture on the box. It looks like they only gave the bottom one coat of stain. Thanks to the dealer who refunded our money. My email with complaints directly to the manufacturer got no response.\n",

This hum is amplified by the thin, light-weight, plastic cabinet. When the motor is turned up to higher speeds the fan creates an unacceptable level of noise.The first time I cleaned the wick, following the directions in the owners care & use manual, the paper element began collapsing and would have completely fallen out had I not caught it in time.I seriously regret spending so much money on such an inferior product!\n",

I enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie. There are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing. At most, I would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship. A genuine friendship that is rare today.

He was also a wonderful stylist, and a precocious one: many writers never write as well as Tynan did while still in his teens. These letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language, but there's more to them than that. Tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider, as someone pushing the envelope; yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play, and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as Shakespeare and Sophocles. These letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character, making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography.

Unlike most travel memoirs, there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture -- even though there were times that I, a fellow traveler, longed for Mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country -- making this book a fun, unrestrained ride through a remote, Kafka-esque kingdom.

Its more of a background music, while doing your business. Its just brilliant. Every track in amazing from beginning to end. I was unfamiliar with Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heild's work. This cd however makes me want to definatly look into it. It is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film.

There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star. Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as \"The Road Warrior.\" And \"The Road Warrior\" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.\"Mad Max\" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today. This film is a classic in the \"action hero\" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.\n",

The pacing of the film changes entirely, as do the characters. The original soundtrack breathes new life into this film.The features are great, there's a trivia track that pops up info about the production, cars, and Aussie slang terms used as you watch it, 2 documentaries, TV spots, theater trailer, and more.The print is fabulous, and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen. Having seen it both ways now I can tell you that the pan & scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action.

This is the best album I've ever heard, and I listen to this album while I study and you should listen to this while you're at work or home. Stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them. Bye-Bye! :-)\n",
      "__label__2 Perfect Family Fun!!!: This is a very funny movie that stars Martin Short as Murray, a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right. His first job is helping Anabel Greening, played by Mara Wilson. Anabel's wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical, and she wants him to get the part. Unfortunately, Murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue. When Anabel, her brother Charlie, and Murray go to NAFGAa and tell the Queen of the Fairy Godmothers what happened, she tells Anabel that if they don't reverse the spell by midnight, he will remain a statue forever. Before they can do that, they have to get the wands back from the evil Claudia. I highly recommend A SIMPLE WISH!!!\n",

As others have mentioned, the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box, because they are all wood and cut from one piece. After about three uses, however, they are now smooth and fit together well. I have not had a problem with splinters, but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces, I could see how splinters might develop.My 21-month old daughter loves this puzzle, and had no trouble putting it together without a visual \"guide.\" The colors of each area are very distinguishable, so it's pretty easy to determine where each piece connects.

In the process Bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole.For me personally this is possibly the most important Vietnam book I've read. This is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war, from the beginning of American involvement to the end, that I still use.For many readers, this could be an important first book to read about Vietnam and America's relations to it.\n",

At least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer's masterpiece, Die Gezeichneten, and while I wouldn't disagree with that judgement, this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling, particularly in the second half. Other than Mozart, Bizet's Carmen and a small handful of others, I'm not a great opera fan but Schreker's output in this genre to be absolutely stunning. Highly recommended.\n",

She is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of \"Lament\" it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality.

We either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable.We've had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves.I'm very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it's clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago.My opinion is \"save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on\", that's what we're doing now.\n",

We ordered two twins for our camp. Mine started leaking immediately. My husbands seemed to be good from Spring to nearly Winter when his too began to leak, so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat. That was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge. My father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again. Our camp closes down during Winter so Spring will be the big test. I suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these. Then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there's hope.\n",

As a college student and missions student, I'm sure it will be used again.\n",

First, two the curves on the top (not sure what exactly they are called) merged into one so I had to sleep on one half of the bed. Recently, I noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it. Shortly afterward I heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn't think too much off it. Then in the middle of sleeping I woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it, and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor. Tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up, then I found out that the main support line is for their pools. I would recommend a different brand like Coleman, or getting something from Cabela's.\n",

I like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size. I think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside.

First, it is very heavy and hard to hold (if you are using it by yourself). Second, it hurts your clitoris. It is very sharp on the ears, that's the part that goes on you clit. I'm almost temped to cut them off. Third and forth, it smells and it is very loud.I've tried it about 4 times, trying to get used to it. My husband has tried to use it on me too. No luck at all.

She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!\n",
      "__label__2 Fantastic (and FAST!): This is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality! :) I got the clear one cause like other reviews say, your eye really doesn't jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum \"my first vibrator\" hahaha!It's really QUIET for something that moves/does so much and it is more powerful than I expected. I had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration - but even THAT got the job down in 26 seconds (yeah, I timed it). This might take some getting used to for some but I absolutely love it!The only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more \"lifted\" off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one. People have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have A smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale - and it went away after 2 or 3 washes.I highly recommend buying this!\n",

But that's all it has, is looks...After using the keyboard, it quickly became tedious to use, since not only are the keys hard to push down, they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places, and the wireless is hit and miss, possibly because it runs at only 49MHz frequency. It will miss keys here and there, so you have to type very slooow, and check your work very often, and with passwords where you can't see what you are typing, good luck! It quickly becomes a tire... There is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature...The processor is 2 \"generations\" older than the current dual core intel processors and the RAM is standard DDR instead of DDR2...Unless HP updates the components and the keyboard, this is a terrible value and a POS.\n",

Because of this, their lives ended with their tragic deaths, making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for.I like this story because it shows the bravery young people have, without caring what adults say. They should have thought this better, so their wouldn't have ended in the tragic way they did, both of them committing a tragic suicide. This tragic also affected other lives, such as their parents, which suffered a lot for them.\n",

Who doesn't like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers? Who hasn't already heard the legend? The play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly, and it's beautifully written. Romeo and Juliet are so tragic in their love, and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless. Read it for the story, but enjoy it for the beautiful prose.\n",
      "__label__1 RoMeO aNd JuLiEt!!!!: We think that the book was a great influence to our English because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things, to look up words in the dictionary and new words.We liked the end when all the main characters died. It left me a great message.

I would point out all the absurdities in the film, but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives. So here goes: Kevin Sorbo, while delivering a truly pathetic performance -- I swear! He must have been drinking while filming this -- looked to be in fairly good shape. That's it!\n",
      "__label__1 What the Heck ???: The uniforms were ridiculous, mixing ribbons and stripes on officer's uniforms..the technical advisor should be fired....I had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep...Kevin Sorbo...puleeze don't get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again...a real stinker !!!!!\n",
      "__label__1 Cute, But a Little Cheap...: This is a nice costume, but the material is quite cheap. Also, it makes my bust look strange (because the black part is right in the middle of it). But the bottom part is really cute, I LOVE the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt.I just don't really like it, myself. I think it could be better.\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointed: I'm glad I read the reviews! I agree, if I can't choose my color I don't want to order. There is another box, very similar (doesn't lock) where I can choose my color. That one I will order. Thanks for all YOUR reviews!\n",

      "__label__2 Not classic Yello - but very very good!: Not everyone can like every album. But, for me, One Second is my all-time favorite. I have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers. One Second is different from Yello's other albums and, in my opinion, doesn't hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno. While the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there (and brilliantly done), the sound is less annalog and has more feel. It is not background music, but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed. The latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for Shirley Bassey's style and voice. In my mind, this album creates its own genre of music which I have yet to find elsewhere. It is different, but it is very very good!\n",
      "__label__1 Disappointed!: Thrilled at my daughter's pregnancy, I purchased this book for her because I could remember how much I admired it 25 years ago when I read it. Her feedback? \"Mom - it's really good until it gets to homosexuality. It fails miserably there!\"I just reread the passage on page 144 of the library edition and now I want to throw it out of the public library's collection! (I won't....I'll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive Brigg's out-dated and misinformed attitude!) But I won't give it 5 stars any more!\n",
      "__label__1 A double edged sword: This book is unlike most of the books written on the topic. While Nuel Emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball, to release new information on Manson and the case against him, he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren't really Manson \"in his own words\" but were nothing more than fabrication.\n",
      "__label__1 MANSON HATES EMMONS.: Watch Charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say,\"Emmons took his life, and put that in my book..then he took my life, and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life..so he's milked you for two books.. he's a good crook.\"The way Charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than 1 percent is factual.\n",
      "__label__1 Lies, Lies, Lies: For all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in Charlie's own words, you're mistaken. At the time of the so called interviews, the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils, tape recorders, etc. The words you see are those of the authors. Same old media hype to make a buck. The author betrayed Charlie by pretending to be his 'friend'. This is why Charlie declines so many interviews. Everybody distorts everything he has ever said. So my advice is: If you want to read the authors take on Charlie, buy it. If you want the TRUTH, don't buy it.\n",

You wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter, I was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first. I look forward to more books By Trisha R. Thomas. I wish it could have went the other way, but the author made it very believable.\n",
      "__label__1 sadly predictable: If you don't like to be surprised in the least bit, this novel is for you. If you don't mind the writer's technique or don't see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book. I, on the other did not. The plot was predictable,the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of McMillan. ( an unpolished McMillan, of course.) The best part of this book was the cover, and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied.\n",

      "__label__1 Klaatu Hopeless: I purchased the original Klaatu album on vinyl in 1976. I love the album as much now on CD as it did then. However \"Hope\" is far too theatrical, with virtually no actual songs on it. If I could give it 0 stars I would.\n",
      "__label__2 A Must read: This book and author were interviewed on Friday 16 April by Bill Moyers on PBS. Fascinating. The book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do NOT understand. All government officials need to read this! Well written. Makes you think.\n",
      "__label__2 A unique take on a classic theme: I really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times. There are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing. Aside from these short comings, however, The science & plot work well together. The characters are reasonably complex & the universe captivating.\n",
      "__label__2 One Brave Act changes a civilization: this story is gripping in part because the 2 female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew. They are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally. The act of the captain to pursue the fleeing \"object\" and thus stranding here crew forever, inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny. That this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew, there is a span of billions of years. This book is about responsibility and living up to it, including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake. great read\n",

      "__label__2 Thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman.: After watching the Masterpiece Theatre presentation of \"Portrait of a Marriage\" years ago, I went on a search for more information about the life of Vita Sackville-West. This bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure. Having only been able to find it in UNCA's library at the time, I was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at Amazon.com. I have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject I call \"The Three V's.\" The three V's are: Vita Sackville-West, Violet Trefusis, and Virginia Woolf, three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with Vita Sackville-West acting as the hinge.\n",
      "__label__1 Buyer Beware!!: If I'd only read the reviews before purchasing this for my 6 year old I would never have bought it! It is VERY flimsy and top heavy. The elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together. As I was driving all over town looking for the best price I wondered why no store had the batcave out on display. Once we got it together I realized why. We ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over. We have lots of batman toys and other mattel products. This is by far the biggest disappointment in 10 years of toy buying. If it wasn't from Santa it would be going back without a doubt. Buy anything else!\n",
      "__label__1 This will be an additional toy for next spring's yard sale: Our almost 4 year old couldn't wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection. It looks great on the box. However, this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost 8 years. It is so flimsy and cheaply built. Pieces fall off and it tips a lot. Hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials. If you are considering purchasing it...don't...you'll save your self some money and frustration.\n",
      "__label__1 Worst scanner I've owned.: I was looking forward to a new scanner after my HP died after just a year. I purchased this one based on the several good reviews on Amazon and other sites.Now that I have the scanner I am sorely disappointed. The picture quality is horrible. No matter the tweaking I do in the scanner dialog, the picture is faded and grainy.The software itself is the least useful interface I've ever worked with. The \"auto\" buttons makes the image worse, the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right, and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to Paperport, something I never want to do.\n",
      "__label__2 a childhood favorite: In \"The Greengage Summer\" five English youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of France derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite. While she is in hospital, they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters. Each of the youths pursues his or her interests (painting, photography, etc.) while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby. They befriend the handyman Paul, a young man with a perplexing past, and bond with their temporary guardian, Eliot, whose background, they eventually discover, is even more disturbing. In their summer stay, the children also stumble upon a mystery. As they collide with a foreign adult world, they receive an education, but not quite the one their mother originally intended.\n",

If you're pre 10.2.X on a Mac you'll have to visit Iogear's website for USB 2.0 drivers. You shouldn't have any problems using this card with a G5 given the bus supports PCI cards either. Apple should just sell this card in their stores. This is my first Iogear product, and this is the best combo firewire/usb PCI card currently on the market.\n",
      "__label__2 Great Book: For those of you who might think that a Clavell novel might be a little too long for you, this book is great, and the shortest of the six books in the Asian Saga. Plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you. Emotionally, and as a result of reading a good book\n",
      "__label__2 Most Interesting Ending: This is an excellent book, and of the Clavell books I have read (all except Gai-Jin), this has the most interesting, if not the best, ending. It seemed to me that Clavell got slightly redundant with the \"natural disaster\" ending, but he managed to avoid it in this book. I found that the way the story and the character's individual stories were resolved (or rather unresolved) fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a WWII prison camp. Oh yeah, the rest of the book is pretty cool, too\n",

      "__label__1 Decent player... while it lasts: After a little over a year my Zen Xtra has stopped playing sound. Everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on Creative's players. On a dinky $30 portable I wouldn't expect much but on a $300 device this is just unacceptable.Their warranty period and customer service is a joke. Go have a look at their forums. Stay away from Creative products. There are other alternatives out there.\n",

Now i'm wondering what to do with an item that I paid nearly $400 because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago (\"limited\" being somewhat of an understatement). No one should ever have to consider \"fixing\", and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for.A month ago I would've given this item four stars. After coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that Creative continues to neglect, I'm outright angry that I'm not alone.\n",
      "__label__2 Discontinued 70PD05500032?: Another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for. I was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued. Is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique? Their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price. When you get to the store, they don't have it but when they look it up in their computer, it shows up as \"Discontinued\". It is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about(a)different model(s) from the one you actually buy online or in-store. The Creative Labs' own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion.\n",

      "__label__1 Design is flawed.: If you grind a lot of coffee, over time you will realize that the rotation of the grinders is in the same direction as you slide the cover to remove it. The result is, that you will have to physically hold the top to the base when you grind beans.After a little over four years, the motor of the older model of this unit burned out.I should have never gotten rid of my Krups grinder.\n",

It grinds the beans very unevenly - some large pieces and some very fine dust, even on the \"Percolator\" (coarsest) setting. When you brew the coffee the fine dust goes right through the metal filter and ends up in your cup.On the plus side, it is easy to clean and maintain. It may work fine if you use paper filters.\n",
      "__label__1 Unreliable: First thing in the morning, while I'm still waking up and maybe a tad groggy, the last thing I want is a finicky coffee grinder. I bought this coffee grinder and used it daily for a few months, when it started working only some of the time. Some days it would work righty off the bat, and other days it had to be disassembled and cleaned and reassembled, usually 2 or 3 times... unplugging it every time for safety. This added annoying minutes to the process of getting the first cup of coffee in the morning. It got to be so annoying that I put the grinder away in the cabinet and bought a bag of pre-ground coffee. When that ran out, the coffee grinder came out of the cabinet again, and this time it didn't work regardless of how many times it was cleaned and disassembled. Now I'm in the market for a new coffee grinder.\n",

The graphics are very in-your-face, however (Being an arachnophobe, I nearly fell off my chair when a spider jumped out at me!). I admit, if you are into adventure games with a little more action, I reccomend the Lord Of The Rings games or The Chronicles Of Narnia: Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe. It doesn't have too much action, especially at the beginning. This is the perfect game to get into gaming with, it's short and sweet.And if you are a serious gamer, get this for your PC as well.\n",

After collaborating with the Germans in the genocide against the Jews in 1942, the Ukrainian nationalists abandoned German service and formed genocidal bands directed at defenseless Polish civilians. Children were impaled on stakes, and adults were quartered, etc. This was no \"liberation of the Ukraine\", as Ukrainians had voluntarily co-existed with Poles for centuries on territories which had possessed a mixture of Poles and Ukrainians for centuries, if not from antiquity.\n",

Striking at the heart of the Church's prayer (i.e., the Psalms) strikes at the heart of the Church's belief. The insipid \"modernization\" of the Glory Be and other traditional prayers has me scratching my head, too: who takes it upon themselves to even do this, then publish it and disseminate it among the faithful, anyway?I eventually gave up on this volume, out of frustration, and began praying the Psalms with the Douay-Rheims Bible and the Latin Vulgate, learning a little Latin as I went on.

This project included the Album Favorite: \"Good Love\".

      "__label__2 Breathtaking Story for East and West: Believe me, as soon as I move with the story of novel, the irresistible force dragged the reader with such strength that reader forgets who has written the novel.The major messages of this novel are to the western readers - wonderfully affectionate mothers and ever lasting friendship across genders. Both tragedies and comedies overlook each other, ultimately all the characters combine into an active group in the memory of Vasavi, go back to soil, resounding what great Tagore wrote, \"Lets go back to earth\", which took shape of developmental NGO, PRAGATI, which is a dream in our life, not unreasonably. Once started reading this novel, one remains breathless till the novel ends. The contour of the novel is never and no where flat, rather full of ups and downs, lovely twists and bents. Surely this novel will win hearts of many western readers who lack emotion about mother and friendship\n",

Smallville and Battlestar Galactica charge that much for entire seasons composed of 20-22 one hour episodes (for seasons one and three for BSG, anyway, since I still don't understand the 2.0, 2.5, 4.0, and 4.5 crap, but I waited for the price to drop on those as well).And on top of that, the packaging of previous volumes has been done away with for the cheaper flip box. If a premium price is going to be charged, then I expect premium services.So my complaint isn't the show, which I still give five stars to, but the price and packaging. I did my usual thing of waiting and waiting and the price eventually came down, but lets be serious. Shouldn't have to do that.\n",

After that volumes 4-8 are all 13 episodes per volume at $30+ each. Greed is what I call it and in this economy, its outrageous. I don't know about you but I'll wait until it drops to $19.99 or less before I'll buy it. Same goes for American Dad.Oh and about the writer's strike, just an excuse to only release the 13 episodes per volume. Fox could have waited for the strike to be over and release full seasons per volume and the year the strike happened, release that season and price it appropriately for the short fall of episodes.\n",

When the paperback collection was released in the 70s, I was baited by the tag line calling him a \"supernatural Sherlock Holmes\". The stories are well written almost to the point of classic literature, introducing characters with a taste for excitement, a never-ending knowledge of the bizarre and an interesting sense of justice (The Corpse-Master from \"the Casebook Of Jules de Grandin\" is an excellent example this.) Who cares if a few of the stories were a little campy, even those tales were fun to read. Since I bought the collection in the seventies, I've lost two of the volumes to \"Acts Of God\" but the four survivors have remained a treasured part of my library, worthy of rereading several times.\n",

This andFactory Showroomare probably the only two TMBG albums that I would say are winners straight through (although I haven't listened to their kids albums - yet). Others, like Apollo 18 or The Else, are a mix of hits and misses, but these two just keep on delivering.

It's a 3 minute limit - and I was never informed of this on Amazon. Now I've spent $150 for practically nothing. On top of that, when I got this camera, the battery kept dying, even WITH a full charge. So I had them send me another battery, which kept dying on me the same one the last one did.

Compared to Epson's paper, the Canon is the closest film developed on paper! The Canon paper is smooth, shiny and the colors are vivid. Without the perforations, the paper looks like it's developed professionally. Every package comes wrapped in a clear plastic sealed bag, and inside are the 20 sheets of photo paper along with a soft tissue paper to protect the first sheet, and a hard cardboard on the back to keep the photos nice and flat.The only problem is that the surface of the Canon Photo Paper Pro is that it's easily to scratch when rubbing against other paper or your fingernail. It's not too noticable unless you look at it in an angle in the light.But overall, it's the best paper for 4\"x6\" photos you want to print yourself! Great quality from Canon, I'm not buying Epson paper again.\n",

Common sense I know, but give yourself some room to remove the handgun without banging it on the sides, or under the lip of the sides, or even having to finagle it out of the vault completely. I intended to place a .38 Special revolver in it, BUT the tip of grip to tip of barrel was just a tad too long. So now I either buy a new, smaller handgun, or a bigger vault! Also, there is not a 9volt battery included, so you should have one ready so you can program your new code immediately. It's a GREAT gun vault. I just didn't measure twice first.\n",

This DVD, with three solo songs and the rest with his amazing band, comes as close to capturing that feeling as video possibly can. The sound quality ranks with the finest concert recordings of all time. Paul has found the ultimate blend of rock, blues, gospel, classic R&B; and country. He and this band sound like no one you have ever heard and that's exceedingly rare anymore. The DVD and bonus live CD are one the greatest values in recorded music you will ever find.

It's the only CD that I own that I don't skip songs on...everything flows, the mood is never interrupted, and the words conjure images as clear as photographs in the listener's mind. The Cure excel musically on this record as few bands ever will, and the poignancy and wistfullness of Robert Smith's words is touching, moving and exhilarating. Behind the tapestry of instrumental genius lies a raw emotion seldom found in rock music. I recommend this CD to anyone who doesn't already own it; this is one record that makes the listener participate in the artist's vision.\n",

Alas, it's totally boring rock. I understand that The Cure wanted to try their talented hands at ethereal rock or whatever, but this stuff just drags on and on and on like a movie or something. Yes, it's very cinematic; cinematic with Smith's mopey vocals, which sound so much better when he's in a good mood. And why wouldn't the guy be in a good mood? HE MAKES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS!!

I have most of his cds and really enjoy his voice. The concern I have for this cd as well as his other cds is material content. Michael usually does't choose the songs that I enjoy listening to. He chooses a repertoire that is not necessary the big hits of yester year. One thing i'm certain of is that Michaels' voice always sounds good on all songs.With the voice of Michael on the so called great songs, I think that he would have one great cd after another. Perhaps he should take my suggestion and try this new approach to song selection. There's really nothing to loose and a lot of gain.Recommendation: I can not recommend this cd.\n",

      "__label__2 Great Fun---Glad It's a Series: I happened upon this series by accident, and a lucky accident it was. I've been reading the books in order. The series doesn't disappoint and I thought this book was the best so far. There's an immaculate confection (no, it's not Doug Flutie with icing,) skullduggery in the vestry, a maybe miracle, and a developing romance. In addition to the central mystery, each book also contains the main character's wonderfully horrible Raymond Chandleresque novella. The writing is clever and the language is an absolute joy and laugh-out-loud funny. Bar none, the novellas have the very best awful mile-long similes ever written.Although much of the plot involves an Episcopal Church, the story is neither preachy nor sacrilegious. The plot moves along quickly, the characters are likeable, and the stories are great fun. The price of the books is a steal. I'll probably regret saying all this because the publisher will jack up the price. Be that as it may, this is a fun read.\n",

      "__label__1 Not a good substitute: An employee at Sephora recommended this conditioner to me as a replacement for my Dr. Hauschka lip balm stick. It was around the same price range so I bought it. It leaves a white film over my lips and makes my lips peel. However, it isn't completely useless, I use Cauldie's lip conditioner to remove all the dead skin from my lips and then put my regular Hauschka lip balm on (now that I can find it at Whole Foods). I won't be repurchasing this item. It's a shame that I couldn't share a wonderful experience like everyone else had. It just goes to show you, product react differently on people.\n",
      "__label__2 Good for vocab and ideas: This book is handy for those intermediate level Spanish speakers who want to increase vocabulary about certain topics. The ideas are not very sophisticated at all, but it presents ideas from different perspectives, and provides some decent vocab. I've been using it to prep for the Foreign Service Spanish exam, and it has proven helpful. It doesn't cover enough abstract ideas for the 3 level, but it gives enough vocab and grammar to help you get there.\n",

      "__label__2 I HAVE LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM THIS BOOK!: I am currently in college taking pipe drafting courses. We use this book as our textbook along with the accompaning workbook. I find it to be very knowlegable and informative as well as well written. It explains step by step how to draw your pipes manually, using auto cad and pro-pipe as well. Illistrations are very good also. My husband has been a welder for 22 years, and now he is also taking this course with me, and agrees with my opinion. This teaches you the basics of piping it is not an indepth book on the subject. but for beginners it is outstanding I would highly recommend it to any one interested in the subject...Kathy Noland\n",
      "__label__2 La La Love it: The Pixies were so irresistably cool and catchy. Doolittle sounds like it was made in some intergalactic recording studio hurdling through the solar system. Who knows what the hell \"Debaser\" is about but holy crap does it rock! The rest of it is just so twisted and good it would be a crime to ignore it. The Pixies may have been the last truly fresh and original band to come out.\n",
      "__label__2 Surprisingly there are those, that aren&#65533;t familiar with this: Having always seemingly been compared to \"Nirvana\"...this does the `Pixies' little justice, as this...their best album is a far more multi-tentacled beast than anything `Nirvana' has done. First track \"Debaser\" is an ambitious accessible straight out the bag College Rock track that is one of those tracks that anybody who's heard the album always mentions. But it would be foolish to not equally praise their other exceptional tracks, \"I Bleed\" giving a gloomy take on Ironic Pop, but its the irresistibility of \"Here Comes your man\" that invokes images of `The Velvet Underground' at their very best...often bemused by peoples perception of their as a populist band, singer/frontman \"Black Francis\" Quoted as saying...\"Everyone thinks the Pixies were a incredibly popular band, but we were just a Cult band\". Cult band or not...they are one of the most consistently brilliant Rock/Grunge albums bands ever devised.\n",

      "__label__2 Doolittle: Doolittle being the Pixies 2nd studio album and their 1989 release and the critics loved it and Allmusic and Rolling Stone Magazine gave it max score. I agree with them. This is an incredible album. Two singles were released \"Here comes your man\" and \"Monkeys gone to heaven\". The booklet is quite strange but contains all the lyrics and has a list of whom and what they play on the album. 5/5.\n",
      "__label__2 PIXIES CLASSIC!!!: I really enjoy all the stuff Pixies create, and the songs of the classic DOOLITTLE are all high points in Pixies career!

So I went on a search for the album on CD format--found a new one for a LOT of money. So what a thrill to find it \"fulfilled by Amazon\" at a great price for a used CD. I've never bought a used CD on line before, but I trust Amazon, so I added it to my most recent order. I am THRILLED to have these songs back again. I don't always like Linda Ronstadt, but the songs on this album, especially w/ Aaron Neville, are awesome. The actual CD case was slightly scratched, but well worth it to save over $20! And the CD itself looks & plays like NEW! Thanks Amazon\n",
      "__label__1 Bad Rheingold Mastering: I had looked forward to this set esp. after the wonderful work Archipel had done with their mastering of the Knappertsbusch 1952 Parsifal and Meistersinger. However, the Rheingold suffers from the same terrible remastering that afflicts their 1953 Forza remastering. On headphones the voices are all shoved over to one side with the orchestra on the other and there is artificial reverb added - I understand the last three operas are better but I didn't bother . A disappointment.\n",

      "__label__1 Transform is dissapointing.: Powerman 5000's relase of Transform is definatley one of the most dissapointing relases. All the good stuff about PM5K (the sci-fi themes, space suits, the nice vocals) have all gone away, and turned into just anothers simple alt band. PM5K should have relased anyone for doomsday, because we would have different to listen to that sounds like what PM5K should song like, other than the amazing Tonight The Stars Revolt. I am PM5K fan, and I hope they don't continue going down this road on the next albums.\n",
      "__label__1 Enjoy: I purchased this album after hearing a (1) song from it. The songs in this album are both new (to me) and (old classics). All of the music is compelling and exciting. You can listen, dance or exercise to the music and none of the songs are boring or lacking in an rhythm that makes you want to move.\n",
      "__label__1 Doesn't work with cable tv: This unit only works with DirectTV, it does not allow you to integrate cable or air tv with the same system. Seems pointless if you want to be able to record multiple programs from both sources.\n",
      "__label__1 Don't buy: When I bought the Tivo set I thought it was great and really enjoyed all the features. But now after just 4 month the modem in the Tivo set is broken, which means it can't dial into the program guide etc. anymore. this means Tivo is pretty much useless. I thought this should be not a big deal until I found out [what it costs to] send in the set to Philips (plus shipping). Just to repair the modem!!! I get a whole new set for that price! Besides the fact that Philips seems to have a problem with their customer service (the average hold time is 45 minutes - I tried it every day during the last 2 weeks). Tivo is great if it works but the machine itself seems to have some mechanical problems that they need to fix before I will buy a set again. If you buy it, just buy it with a warranty.\n",
      "__label__2 TIVO changed our TV watching life: The TIVO is a terrific product that immediately changed the way my wife and I watch the tube. We got the 30 hour model. Setup was a bit time consuming and required a trip to Radio Shack for some additional cables, but the instructions are detailed and easy to follow.There are four or five shows we like to watch weekly and we are now free to see them at our leisure. Too tired to watch ER or Saturday Night Live? Need to go to a school meeting on Wednesday night but don't want to miss West Wing? Want to watch Seinfeld reruns? No problem. Watch them when you like. And the pause feature is fantastic. Make yourself a sandwich; Take the call from your mother. The show is waiting for you when you return. We now rarely watch live TV because TIVO has recorded other stuff we'd rather see than the usual dreck. You'll never need to watch another annoying commercial. We LOVE this thing! Great remote control, too.\n",
      "__label__2 Evolve or Dissolve!: To anybody who feels that metal should stay stagnant in their progress of their evolution should then stay with Linkin Park, Trapt or Godsmack. If you do you won't ever be disappointed. For those of you who take great pride in watching some of your favorite bands take the next step in musical progress should then take a hardy bite out of this album. Coined with the category \"Math Metal\" by Chad Grey this band is as distant from Nu-Metal as Tool or Deftones as I have heard it described by some. This album blends the raw vocals and unpredictable time signatures of \"LD50\" with the melody of their follow up album \"The End of All Things to Come\" and then pushed the envelope a little more. Mudvayne is much more polished and for that I commend them. And also for that they are a much superior band than they used to be. So get your @$$ moving and pick up this album. You won't be disappointed!\n",
      "__label__1 World owes you recognition, but you owe yourselves progress.: It's trite to re-interpret the title into the critique, but I can't help regarding `Lost and Found' as all too fitting. The best aspects seem like B-sides, while the other two thirds remind the world why radio-potential metal has become so disposable.And Mudvayne is supposed to help us forget.It's painful to imagine that they've hit a creative wall, worse to conceive that they would weaken themselves so as not to intimidate promoters, but I hear those riffs that were worn out 20 years ago and I just don't know. The experimental sharpness is still floating around in here, but it's measured with points rather than an edge.Gather the mob-funds, guys. But come back and remind us how much more you have to give.\n",
      "__label__1 The smell made it unusable for me: Let me say that I'm a John Frieda fan. I use the Frizz-Ease hair serum on my thick, curly hair every day and it works wonders. So I was prepared to like this product.I'm not very sensitive to product scents; I will use most anything if it makes my hair look good. This one is an exception, though. It smells terrible -- to my nose it's a combination of watermelon, dead fish, and baby powder -- and the smell does not go away as the product settles and dries. I couldn't even give this a second test try because it smelled so bad. It did make my hair shiny, but there is no way I could possibly use it. Bummer! I see that a couple other reviewers have liked it, though, so it's definitely a subjective matter and not everyone would find the smell so objectionable.\n",
      "__label__1 Tune Out This Book: Sorry, but if you want to broadcast for more than a few feet, this book is not for you. This book is a collection of low-powered simple circuits, backed with high-powered marketing. The back cover states, \"Now that the FCC has changed the laws governing pirate radio and video stations....\" While there is now a low-power FM service, for which a type-accepted transmitter and license are still required, there have been no \"changes\" governing pirate broadcasting. It's still illegal (and fun). And there is nothing in this book that is going to save you \"thousands of dollars\" over commercial equipment, while giving you the same power and performance. These statements are clearly misleading and get your hopes up (and your wallets out) for something this book is not. It's unfortunate that the author, who is probably capable of doing so, did not write a book to match the promised content.\n",
      "__label__1 Don't bother: To be frank, I found this trilogy so be the absolute worst book that I have ever read (it was an omnibus). The 'hero' spent most of his time whining, and making everyone else suffer along with him. The writing was well done, but the plot and characters were hopeless. Don't waste your time plowing through it...\n",
      "__label__1 Like wading thru cold maple syrup: I will say that Donaldson's settings and concept were unique at the time of this series's conception. It might even be said that he revitalized an ailing genre with his well thought out epic. But be warned; this novel will leave intellectually spent. Covenant is perhaps the most indecisive, whiny fantasy \"hero\" I've ever read. I find him thorougly dislikable. He's the kind of guy you don't ask \"how ya doing?\" because he'll take an hour telling exactly what's wrong with his life.\n",
      "__label__1 Didn't Like it: Tried this book on a recommendation from my brother. Found it really stupid and kind of arrogant in the use of language, like he was trying too hard to impress you with obscure words (and I like to think I have a pretty good vocabulary). Kind of like he swallowed a thesaurus and borrowed other peoples stories besides. Read the whole thing, but have no desire to read any more of the series. Main character too angry and couldn't seem to get over it. Wore me out.\n",
      "__label__1 Beware...a Hero that wines and is unsepathetic: I read this book some years ago and just thinking about it to write this review pains me. It's like trying to remember how it felt to have a stainless steel spike driven thru your skull.The \"Hero\" is annoying, winey and while reading this book, I longed for his death or disappearance. The book is a slow, hard read. If your thing is reading about people you'd never want to run into/ know (and that's our \"Hero\"), then this book is for you!How this book has had a run as a series of books is beyond me. The story has no appeal to me. I can't identify with the main character and it's a horrible read. Honestly, I wish I had never read it. You have been warned!\n",
      "__label__2 A Beautiful Epic of Tolkien Proportions: Donaldson's Thomas Covenant books are masterworks of creative joy, frustration, and eventually triumph. Both the frustration and triumph stem from the intricacies of a complex anti-hero whom the reader will alternately want to curse and salute. The first book, Lord Foul's Bane, is not without flaws, and it does begin slowly as others have noted, but the committed reader will be rewarded with an epic of Tolkien proportions and a world which is painful to depart once the last page is done. I have returned to this series many times over the years, and it holds a place of honor in my collection.\n",

      "__label__2 An excellent album: This is a great album. There is a breadth of tone and subject matter, though all the songs come from Billy Bragg's perspective, and are quite political in nature. To specifically address one criticism on this site, Billy did not write a new tune for 'The Red Flag', he states that he is returning the lyrics to their ORIGINAL tune, which is a lively Irish reel; the effect is to give the song the energy and enthusiam it requires.\n",
      "__label__1 Hymns to holocaust: Bragg has always been abysmal as a singer/songwriter, but recording the anthem of a political movement that killed millions around the globe is in bad taste--even for pop music. Crank it up, comrades, and blast back to the era of the gulags, that era you love so well.\n",

      "__label__1 Everything but ...: The Sony CD clock radio almost has everything I was looking for. A CD player. Easy use of both alarms. The ability to set both alarms to the radio (this sounds simple, but many CD clock radios (Timex, Panasonic) allow a sound source to be associated with only one of the alarms). Good sound. Very good looks. But unlike most clock radios, it does not have a battery backup. As my area periodically gets short blackouts, this is needed. Especially since getting to work depends upon it. If you do not need the backup, go for it. Otherwise, look elsewhere.\n",

As I am a tarot reader and collector, I have some decks and always refused incorporating a computer generated deck in my collection but I had to have this deck. I use it for my personal readings and I am always amazed how it \"clicks\" with me. I got some very interesting insights with this deck.I also like the book as it tells about local British myths and lore but I would not recommend it for absolutely tarot newbies.

I'm a sudoku fanatic, so I'm very versed in the rules. When I sat down and started working the puzzles, I found myself running up against instances on every puzzle where the same number would have to appear in the upper left hand box of each sub-section twice within the same puzzle (which is a BIG no-no).

      "__label__1 Deeply Disappointing (sooo glad I only rented it): I was so disappointed with this film: the acting was second rate at best, the greatest offender being the scene with woman at the well (John 4). The ongoing interaction with the Jewish leaders was utterly painful to watch. I remember being so excited about this film, I thought about buying it even before watching it. So glad I only rented it. Believe me, I had heard so many positive things about the film, it made finally watching it even more disappointing. Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\" and the recent \"The Nativity Story\" are so superior in production value, with the finest movie on the life of Jesus Christ remaining Franco Zeffirelli's \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" I'd certainly recommend these over \"The Gospel of John.\"\n",

      "__label__2 What better a witness then the WORD itself: I like the Movie because it is not common to see far straying from the WORD, yet it is drawn from the Alexandrian texts which are gnostic, droping many words, and even entire verses (compare NIV 1John 5:7 to NKJV or KJV). Another thing Isaih said the real LORD was not comely (handsom), nor did he have any form (was not well built). Also Mary Magdeline near the end, gets a lot of camara time for some reason, and keeps acting fluttery. All in all I would watch it several times without feeling like I was wasting time, because any of HIS words are enriching.Praise the LORD Jesus, HE has\"magnified HIS WORD above HIS NAME\" Psalm 138:2b,\"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\" Romans 10:17,JESUS is alive, HE is risen, HE healed my broken heart, and gave me a new life in HIM.\n",

HENRY IAN CUSICK IS PHENOMENAL AS THE MESSIAH; HE IS THE BEST ACTOR CAST AS JESUS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. THE DIRECTING IS AMAZING AND CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER AS NARRATOR IS PERFECT. I PERSONALLY WATCH THIS MOVIE ON A REGULAR BASIS, IT IS TRULY THE WORDS OF THE GOSPEL BROUGHT TO LIFE.\n",

I know Memphis is mostly about Elvis, Sam and Dave, Al Green, Sam the Sham, Carla and Rufus Thomas, Booker T and the MGs, Charlie Rich, Otis Redding and the Bar-Kays, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Three Six Mafia, all sorts of rockabilly and soul and gutbucket and rap. But this is really great, too, in a completely different way, more like Big Star and Alex Chilton when he's not really angry and bitter. This is ethereal and damn near giddy music... it's intelligent, rooted in 60's white pop with a carefully crafted psychedelic edge. It floats along, pulls you in and...well, it makes you feel happy. It's ultra-modern -- nobody else sounds like this -- and it's very smart. I can't wait for the follow-up. I'm the Big Oh and I gotta go.\n",

Well, even if he's stealing stuff from John McPhee, I really enjoyed Fallen Man, and I think he's getting even better with First Eagle. I enjoy a good knotty plotline and both of these books deliver. One more note, quite frankly, I never really could stand Janet Pete. Chee needs to stop moping and go after Bernie.\n",
      "__label__1 I eagerly anticipated this book and was disappointed.: This book was not up to the standards I have come to expect in Tony Hillerman's Chee and Leaphorn series. The plot was convoluted and yet uninteresting and formulaic. Chee and Leaphorn in previous books had appealing personal characteristics. In this book, all the characters were ho-hum.\n",

This is good, not absolutely earth-shattering, but that's not the point of these things, as they are tributes by artists who love the band. I gotta say that so far, the Steve Grimmett tracks have to be my favorites, he even comes close to Bruce Dickinson's greatness at times. Di'Anno's, while great, seem to be lacking something in the delivery, but that just might be the fact that he's older than he was when he originally recorded them. Then there's Bernie Shaw singing \"Fear of the Dark\" which was great to me because I'm a huge Uriah Heep fan and he definitely brings some of that spirit to the song. All in all, a pretty standard tribute, definitely recommended to all Maiden fans!!!\n",

I wish I had returned them, but thought that if I bought better insoles they would be comfortable, but they really aren't, and I have to wear extra thick socks with these although I still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes. I regret that I threw out the box and cannot return them. They are a waste of my money.\n",

That is completely unacceptable. I wish I had read the reviews before buying. Apparently this happens with great frequency. Save $50 and much aggravation and check out the Sony Fontopia's. Those lasted me a year which prior to this was dissapointing. I spent the extra money for increased durability and was completely wrong. You don't get what you pay for. Avoid V-Moda like the plague!\n",

They don't sound quite as good as the higher end (Ultimate Ears or Shure), but good for the money. They are a tiny bit thin on the Bass, but better than most in their price range. If you need more bass, check out the V-MODA Bass Respone phones.They do need a \"burn-in\" period though to reach their capability.\n",

It was very deceiving, when I got home and popped these out, plugged them in I was sooo disappointed with the highs on in the headphones. It was very scratchy every time something not even that high would be playing...The lows were good BUT they do not make up for the highs. DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES UNLESS YOU ONLY LISTEN TO MUSIC WITH JUST LOWS.\n",

I used it fairly actively ran a lot with it walked everywhere with them on etc.Now first thing to go was the metal sleeve on the 3.5 connector, it was sliding off and whatever no big deal this happened about a month in. Then the next thing to go was my left ear buds insulating wire, exposing it slowly, still worked fine but it was slowly dieing, then near the connector the insulation broke there too exposing the wire. Then the right earbud's wire was exposed then the left one stopped working altogether. That's when I got new earbudsOverall, i wouldn't buy these again, almost got tempted since i noticed it had a different design on the connector so i thought maybe they got better, but this time i'm gonna heed other peoples reviews and still not get them.\n",

I have to constantly adjust the wiring just so that the dead ear bud can come back. What's the point of this high grade wire protector if they're just going to give out anyway!? And at $50+ I expected much more from this...FAR more. AT LEAST a year...if they had lasted me at least a year then I'd at least be satisfied with my purchase, but sadly that was not the case. Cheap non-name brand ear buds from CVS lasted me longer than these things! Avoid these, people. Lest you want to suffer the same frustration I experienced. I'm going to try and see if I can't get a new or refurbished pair from the manufacturer. This shoddy overpriced merchandise cannot go on like this!\n",
      "__label__1 Good sound, Bad quality: I bought the red version of these earbuds in January 2008 after tons of research. A lot of the negative reviews I read were about the earbuds shorting out. In my case, after about 2 months, I noticed that the left earbud was now playing at a MUCH reduced volume. At first I thought it was just the stereo mixing of music, but then I realized that, indeed, the volume and bass coming from the left ear bud was very quiet, and now it annoys me to listen to. A couple of months in and I'm SOL - especially since I bought them for $65 on Amazon without a warranty. Splurge for buying them from the manufacturer so you can get them repaired.PROS: Sounds good, look great, easy to get in and out of ears (compared to Shure).CONS: They are already shorted. :(\n",
      "__label__2 Very nice: I was searching for some ear buds to replace the standard iPod issue. I got a pair of Shure e2c's for Xmas and have never been able to get them to fit my ears no matter what fitting I used. After much experimentation I was able to get some of the foam fittings to work but the sound was still lacking. No bass at all. After doing some reading I decided to take a chance on the V-MODA Vibes. At first I was a little concerned they might be to bassie. Well, that is not the case. The bass is definitley there but it's not overwhelming by any means. So far I like the V-MODAs a lot. I was able to wear them right out of the box - I haven't even tried any of the other fittings. Plus they're not as clunky as the Shures. The smaller size enables me to fit almost the entire bud in my ear. I am quite pleased with my purchase. Anyone interested in a slightly used pair of e2c's?\n",

      "__label__1 Extra Noise: One of the worst purchases I have made. The cords to the earbuds are fabric covered and rub against clothing, creating load rubbing background noise that is high decibel and louder than the music being delivered. I have to binder clip them to my collar to get them to be acceptible. Hate them.\n",
      "__label__2 Great sound...but be sure to save receipt: Title says it all. Left channel/bud started to fade after 3 months of use. Never used earphones with ipod in pocket, so bending of cord was unlikely cause of fault.That said, Vmoda stood behind their product, and provided a quick exchange via mail with proof of purchase.Big picture: Tremendous value and sound. Earbuds are great for passive noise reduction of piped guido music at health club and aircraft noise.\n",

      "__label__2 Good sound, but not as noise insulating as I hoped: I bought these primarily to use on my commute. I had read they were great at insulating outside noise. I ride a very noisy public transit train in the SF Bay Area and these earbuds really don't block out enough sound. The train wheels just scream on the tracks in some sectinos. These are comfortable and the sound quality of the music is good but if you are looking for something to insulate outside noise, these won't really do it.\n",
      "__label__1 Great looks, sub-par performance: I purchased these headphones twice. The first time was in summer 2008. The headphones were awesome. However, they crapped out after about two months. I returned them and went with a cheaper set of headphones.I was craving some nice headphones, and I saw the price on these is substantially down from 2008, so I bought them again (spring 2010). Big difference! The external looks are the same, but build quality is down and the sound quality and in-ear comfort is way down. These are headed back to Amazon for a refund.\n",

      "__label__1 Works great, BUT.....: The touchless operation of this trash can works great. Easy to attach and remove trash bag and secure ring to keep bag in place. BUT, the sensor that raises the lid is too wide of range. Walk by within 2ft and lid opens, runs battery down quickly. Have gotten in habit of turning off, except will doing food prep for period of time. The function of no touch use 24-7 was what I was looking forward to. Turning on/off for most of daily use defeats the no touch perk.\n",

The sensor takes about 2 seconds to register before opening the lid, while I'd prefer a little more immediate response, but oh well. Overall, a very cool addition to my kitchen. If it goes bad, I'll come back and update the review.\n",

This could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy, which will save you money, mess, and time.\" is an OUTRIGHT LIE. This garbage can lid worked for about 15 months at best. It no longer opens wide enough to put trash in, and the lid only stays up for a second, if that. Totally useless, overpriced terrible product.\n",
      "__label__1 The lid stopped working within 6 months.: After comparing step cans and prices at Wal-Mart, Kohls, Amazon and eBay, I found this can for $35 at Costco and went for it. We all loved it, it was so convenient! The infrared sensor was iffy, sometimes it doesn't respond, but I had no problem pushing the open button, which worked fine to me. After 6 months though, the lid won't open either with the open button or the infrared sensor. Fresh batteries notwithstanding, I have to dig my fingernail under the lid to open it. Sure, the close button still works, but shouldn't I expect that my garbage can should outlive my garbage?Thank goodness I bought this at Costco, I can return it for a full refund even after 6 months. I'm going to get a reliable and durable step can and skip the $10 of batteries altogether. Good idea, but unreliable technology makes this a loser in the end.\n",
      "__label__2 Saves clean up and time!: I have found this trash can to be a real time saver. First, it has a large opening which prevents spills and other messes. Secondly, because it opens automatically, I spill less and do not dirty the can by touching it constantly. I have had one for two months and am pleased with the performance. Use regular kitchen bags. Getting the kitchen bags in isn't the simplest task, but it does hold the bag in well. Cleans easily. I would recommend.\n",
      "__label__1 What's up with this sensor?: It's interesting that we have recently started experiencing the same problems that others are commenting on. Our sensor has stopped working all together. We have done everything that others say works (replacing batteries, unplugging the cord - which we had to buy separately - and cleaning where the sensor is located), yet this trash can will not work.If you are looking at purchasing this item, please PLEASE read all the comments here first. This device has a very short lifespan - typically a month.\n",

      "__label__2 Worth for the money: My wife saw the review and arranged to get this for our lovely new home. When I unpacked the trash can, i felt it was so thin and weightless, slowly I realised that we do not need really a heavy one for this. It is so far working well and feel the importance of touchless. We had house warming few days ago, and everyone who came to the house warming asked where did you buy this. We have two kids, we thought they may play with it, but not at all. The negative aspect of the touchless is to sensitive, even if you walk near by your dress make them to open many time and secondly I feel the time limit of lid opening bit shorter. But these two negative aspect are very minor problem. I would strongly reccommend this trash can to anybody.\n",

Trash can arrived by UPS and they charged me a $36.82 brokerage fee to bring it into Canada. When I got it home, it did not work. I sent it back UPS and it cost me $73.22 in shipping. Todays Concept gave me a real hassel with the return. I never got my monies back for brokerage fees and the cost to ship it back. I am out over $100.00 on this transaction.

Well it is now Feb 15, I have called 5 times and spoked w/ angela who keeps saying it is being mailed on this date or that. Oh it's sitting in receiving and will be sent today. Oh were looking into it. And so on. Will i get it back or won't I. Oh and no one will claim to be the supervisor. Go ahead call them yourselves 800-660-7978 you'll see.

      "__label__1 Sensitive sensor solution: Not sure if anyone else has posted this solution, all you have to do is cover part of the sensor with black electric tape, the more you cover the closer your hand needs to be for the lid to open. Overall a great trash can, only negative besides the overly sensitive sensor is the stainless steel is a bit too thin.\n",

The trash can arrived in good condition. Easy to operate (once you get the hang of putting in the trash liner which is not really that difficult but you have to make sure the inner ring is in the correct position). Looks clean and neat. Space saving. The reason we didn't give it a 5 star rating is: (1) I couldn't figure out how to give it 4.5 stars; (2) the lid sometimes goes up when you walk close to it (not a real big problem for us but if you had a large family it might); and (3) it would have been really good to have the choice of an adapter so that it could be plugged in. Not real draw backs and none of these have really been a problem but items worth noting. I would order again and have recommended to friends (even those who laughed). My husband and I both love it!\n",

Now-a-days, the door only opens 1/3 of the way. When this first started, my first thought was to change the batteries. When that didn't work, I thought it was due to the batteries being old. So I went and bought new D size batteries. They weren't the cheap dollar store batteries. I bought Energizer batteries just to make sure that they would be full power. Sadly, this has not worked either.So 5 months ago, this trash can was a 5 star. Now it is a 2 star. Unfortunately I expect products to last at least a year before I replace them. This was a waste of money for the trash can (55 dollars) and batteries (12 dollars).The next one I'm going to buy will be a step trash can.\n",

I haved looked everywhere for a new one and decided to try Amazon.com I did find them, and tried to get the same kind but got as close as possible. I was at first very pleased with the product, but within a few days, the rim kept falling inside the can, the batteries kept falling out because the battery cover was not secure. Ended up exchanging the whole can to try it again. I feel this could be a excellent product if the battery compartment were on the back of the lid inside of underneath. Thats the way my previous trash can was made.\n",
      "__label__1 The battery cover didn't fit: I could no way close the battery cover. So I duck-taped it to hold the baerries. But the batteries were too heavy and they became loose and pushed the cover down into the can. This apparently happened when I emptied the can for the first time. (I ordered this on 1/14/2010.) Sometime after that I realized it stopped working, and found that the cover was permanently lost (to the town dump). I duck-taped the batteries directly into the slot, but after a few hours (maybe a few minutes?) the tape could no longer hold the heavy weight of 4 D-batteries, and became loose. So the trash can is totally useless. Had I bought this from Costco, I would take it to the store and they would refund me. But unfortunately I bought it through amazon.com (I had also threw away the box.) I'll just have to throw this trash can into my trash bin to go to the town trash tump. What a trash product it is. If amazon.com keeps selling products like this it will become a trash company as well.\n",

I've only had a problem if I accidentally turn off the power switch in back. I've replaced the batteries only to discover the switch was turned off. My favorite thing about this trash can, however, is when guests come over! Stand in front of the trash can and pretend it's your pet.

      "__label__1 Nice concept, but poor build quality: I received the trash can with several dents on its side, probably due to shipping. After examining the material it was made of, I concluded that the metal was very thin and flimsy. The dents caused the retainer ring to no longer fit properly in the can. I can say that the lid opening mechanism was very smooth and functional, but the poor build quality of the can itself is why I'm returning it.\n",
      "__label__1 Too expensive to only work for a year: I'm so sick of these fancy, expensive metal things where the crucial mechanism - in this case the hinge that opens the lid - relies on a tiny piece of flimsy plastic that breaks. This is a beautiful trash can that I liked while it worked, but the little plastic hinge broke and now it's garbage. I've had the same problem with pedal cans - the whole can is stainless steel EXCEPT for the part that should be, and that part inevitably breaks and leaves me with a useless piece of junk. Grrrr.\n",

As other reviewers stated the mechanism that lets the lid open and close broke off after one year. However, my husband was able to repair it by using super glue. This method worked two more times. Now, that trash can is two years old we can no longer repair it. We are now purchasing our second iTouchless trash can. I hope that they will think about selling the replacement for that mechanism so that when it breaks again we can purchase the part needed instead of the whole product.\n",
      "__label__1 13 gal touchless: Buyer Beware-The engineering is just terrible. The plastic gear that operates the lid is too small and broke early on, The battery compartment opens to the trash hence when the battery lid fails the lid and the batteries go out with the trash. Touchless sent me a new battery lid(10$ plus 4$ shipping) it smartly went out with the trash as well. After juryrigging the battery compartment with tape it worked for one more day then gave up the ghost and died. I now have a 100$ toy that doesn't work and only did work for a total of 8 weeks.\n",

Mine is in an area where people see it as they walk in. It is sharp-looking and free of bag overhang. My pets are not tempted to pull out trash since it is always contained. It has never malfunctioned. The only precautions I would pass along are that (1) it is easy to mistakenly dispose of the big plastic ring that hold the liner when one is taking out the trash; and (2) the plastic sheet covering the battery-pack fell off once and was carried away to the outside trash. I really hesitated when I purchased it ($$), but it turned out to be well worth it.\n",

Also, great reading and pictures! Along with my Southern Living Garden Problem Solver book, I don't need any other gardening books!\n",

It really is a beautiful pan, but the one I received has a sort of pinkish tinge to the beige. I have other LeCreuset products, and none of them look quite like this.It's still pretty, though, and heats up well for cooking.\n",
      "__label__2 Buy This One for One of the Best Song Ever Written: Caruso: There are three songs on this CD.If you have seen the PBS Special, you like me were blown away by the powerful performance. She took this beautiful, compelling song that her mother used to sing, and brought it to a new level. Andrea Bocelli's and Pavarotti's version of CARUSO are no where as fulfulling as the Emotionally Packed, Exquisitely Crafted Masterpiece. This song is Reforged TIMELESS. Like she says, when you heard her interpretation of this song, you see, feel, breath, touch the Culture, Soul, History and Essence of ITALY. Not a Breath was wasted. Every nuance, tone, blend of emotions fell into place. I hope when upon listening this song for the very first time, you will be lifted and transported to another place and time. It is truly an unreal experience. Furthermore, Italian is truly a beautiful, expressive language.I bid you Love and Peace.\n",

Global temperatures peaked in 1998 and have declined since.2. The DVD says that there is one thing worse than more people is affluence. The DVD believes that more people are bad. It is based on the belief that the earth can only support a certain number of people. People have been producing alarmist documents for 200 years warning of the impending limits on population growth. The earth could very well support 1 trillion people.\n",

It would be somewhat challenging for someone who did not have the necessary micro screw drivers and the patience to remove various items. Inside you will find a shoddy piece of electrical tape holding the battery in place - nice touch. After I installed a new battery, reassembled the gauge, and turned it on, I discovered that it reset itself to units that are unfamiliar to me, perhaps pascals. I never did figure out how to change the units. The price of the product is not worth the time I put into it anyway.I don't recommend this digital pressure gauge.\n",

When I first heard Once Again I wasn't sure I would like it, mainly due to my expectations based on Get Lifted. Once Again is not Get Lifted pt.2, it stands firmly on its own two feet, but you will get lifted (pun intended). John blends good old soul music with his own style to create wonderful songs such as \"Each Day Gets Better\", \"Slow Dance\" and \"Where Did My Baby Go\", to name a few. You still get a Get Lifted feel with songs like \"Stereo\", \"Again\" and \"Another Again\". Of course John takes you to his Gospel roots with \"Heaven\" and \"Show Me\". This album has something for everyone, if you go in with an open mind you will come out with a musical experience you won't soon forget.\n",

I actually anticipated somewhat of a sophomore fall off of sorts. You must admit that 1st CD is a tough act to follow. After listening to this CD for a couple of times, I felt it was not quite up to the standard set by his 1st. I mean the 2nd song \"heaven\" and the 7th \"slow dance\" are instant classics in my opinion. But it wasn't until I heard the CD several times, the 4th song \"show me\" and 6th \"p.d.a.\" started to really stand out. I believe as an artist he is as close as you get to the likes of Marvin Gaye. I just happened to hear \"Mercy Mercy Me\" by Marvin after listening to Legend. I found the likeness, striking. I'm not trying to say he is as great, yet, but he has the potential.\n",

After listening once, I tried to listen again and found myself at Half Priced Books where my $10 investment became .75 cents. At least the McDonald's coffee was good. The songs were smooth. Smooth as in flat, without interest or color. Were the words introspective and deeply meaningful?

If i had let the negative reviews get to me then i would have regret it.love!!!! love !!!!\n",

The hardest part was finding the stud in the wall.Con:Only complain I have its the design of the TV mount leaves little space behind the TV. Not a big problem, just make sure to plug in your power cord and other cable before mounting the TV to the wall.\n",
      "__label__2 Great wall mount: It was cheap and it works perfectly. I mounted it twice since I moved 3 months ago. IT tilts down so I can watch TV from my Bed and can be adjusted for perfect position. It does not tilt sideways and does not stick out. I prefer that it does not stick out because I prefer to have it stick to the wall as much as possible. The only thing that is bad about that is it can be hard inserting cables to the TV sometimes.\n",
      "__label__2 For the price you can't go wrong...: I used this to wall-mount my 46\" LED TV in my living room. My parents couldn't believe I got a wall-mount for so cheap when they spent about 4 times as much on theirs! For the price, you can't go wrong. It's not the best mount, but it'll do the trick on a budget. I previously bought a more expensive mount from a store which is what holds my 42\" LCD TV in the bedroom, and I will say that mount is better. The tilt feature on that is better, and unlatching it to take it off the wall (if needed) is easier than it is with this one. Tightening the screws at the bottom of this mount at the end of the installation process was kind of a pain.\n",

      "__label__2 TV wall hanger: This bracket is sturdy. I liked the way the TV just hangs up before you tighten all the screws in the lower bracket clips. It takes a lot to lift the 52\" TV the six feet to the mount but if you can do that then you feel confident that it will not fall down. It took three men to lift the TV above the fireplace. It clipped right in and the rest was easy. I liked the way the TV can slide on the bracket from side to side and tilt to where you like it best.\n",
      "__label__2 Very pleased: I have a 50 inch Panasonic and the mount worked perfectly. Easy to install and they provide screws for all surfaces you would mount to. You need to be able to find the studs in your wall, and once the TV is mounted plugging in new plugs is hard. It is best to plug things in before you put it on the wall. Mount works great though would recommend\n",

I can't understand why someone would pay hundreds of dollars for the SAME thing you can get online for a fraction of the cost. The quality of the mount is great and the mounting is extremely easy. Don't waste your money paying someone to mount your flat screen TV. Do it yourself and save a ton of money. I would highly recommend this product.\n",
      "__label__2 Holding a 65\" plasma well: I bought this to mount our TV and it is working well. The only improvement I'd like to see is for screw holes closer to the middle, so that you can bolt through 3 sets of studs (left, center, and right) when mounting this to the wall...I added the holes to secure to the center stud myself. The level included with the kit...wasn't - but I don't count that as a big negative, as I would expect to have a good quality level myself for a job like this.\n",

The soundtrack is jam packed with glam classics from Brian Eno, T Rex, Roxy Music, PULP, Lou Reed, Venus in Furs etc. Granted that the album is full of priceless glam classics it is not the COMPLETE SOUNDTRACK. I noticed that there are songs that are missing, for example there are two Brian Eno songs featured in the movie that where not in the soundtrack, amoungst others. Speaking of missing songs, it wouldn't have botherd me a bit if they left out the songs coverd by Ewam Mcgregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. I can't believe they where allowed to tarnished an Eno number, and T.V Eye! Their vocals are pathetic! But what redeems the album is the PULP song, and the other glam classics.

The only good songs are Virgina Plain and Satelite of Love and Camel in the eye but those are the original songs and i have those songs allready. The songs of Venus and Furs dispointed me it seem Thom was trying to sound like Bryan Ferry on them it would have been better if he just used his own voice. If you want a good glam rock soundtrack may i suggest Hedwig and The Angry inch most of the songs are sung by one singer who has a better voice then most of the rock singers out today. That soundtrack acutally does not sound like a soundtrack which i think is best i am not a big fan of various artist cds. I ended up selling it for more then i paid for it.\n",

There are no serious breaks in the flow and action and the whole meal was over in wink, leaving me still quite bloodthirsty for more. Don't peek at any plot details! The previews reveal too much. I have to say that I figured this one out almost immediately, and I think you will too. But it's wonderfully done from a dramatic and character perspective.

The entire book consists of an endless succession of \"witness interviews\" interspersed with minute descriptions of every meal this \"full bodied\" woman eats. (And she eats constantly!)

      "__label__1 Why did I bother?: I kind of wanted to see this movie when it originally came out in theaters, but I never got around to it...I'm glad I didn't. This movie was really bad. Most of the scenes just didn't make any sense. The characters weren't likeable at all, I couldn't have cared less if they all got killed. The acting was awful and the script was just down right horrendous. Some of the worst lines came from chris kattan's character like, \"this house is alive, we're all gonna die\" and \"you give me my money right now...I want it, so you give it\". Thats the kind of bad script that I'm talking about. The only slightly decent thing in this movie is some of the special effects. I would also like to give credit to geoffery rush for trying to do the best he could with what he was given. All and all...don't watch this movie.\n",

This was a poor attempt on the writers to make a scary movie out of a nothing plot and it wasn't even that scary. More or less, it was stupid and the idea was very unclear. After watching it, I couldn't tell you what it was about. Well, Actually, it was about a house on haunted hill, but who didn't know that already. 5 people visit it and I bet you can quess what happens from here. They die, amazing. Yeah right. What ever happens to you don't and I mean don't, see this disgrace of a movie.\n",

      "__label__2 Definitely worth a look...at Jeffrey Combs: Jeffrey Combs is underused here (like he is in seemingly every movie that he is in), but Director William Malone utilizes a great score to keeps things moving at a crisp pace, to hide the warts in the plot (like why anyone in their right mind would go downstairs). This is a vast improvement over the stinkeroo of an original. Not real scary, but if they had used more of Jeffrey Combs as the mad doctor, they really could have had something special.Bonus points for the DVD extras, which are excellent. Why would anyone use VHS at this day and age? Go DVD and see this movie in all of its glory.\n",

What was supposed to be a scary good movie turned out a bad, silly, movie.\n",

It's a very nice looking book as well and I particularly like the way his signature is on one of the front pages so you feel as though he has actually signed it for the reader. It's delightful. It is interesting how the reader has the opportunity to 'hear' Michael Jackson's version and intepretation of various events, which is markedly different from the tabloid press and various writers. If you have already read books about Michael Jackson, you will recognise some of the events mentioned in the book. The reader gets an insight into Michael Jackson's interpretation of the world rather than the tabloids' interpretation of Michael Jackson's world.\n",

If you are looking to get a sense of what Michael was like and how he truly was , then read this book. I recommend this book to any MJ fan and also \" The Magic and the Madness \" By J. Randy Taborelli . Michael went through so much when he was alive. It almost sadness me to read all that he had dealt with. He was such a good person. A caring person, a true humantarian.

He has secretly rigged the house with insidious devices designed to scare the guests out of staying, but his tricks soon become meaningless, as thr mansion begins to generate terror on its own. Before their night of terror is over, the desperate inhabitants will unlock the secrets of the house or suffer the wrath of the demonic evil that haunts the walls of the former insane asylum.House on Haunted Hill is a forgettable movie with laughable performances and a flippin' terrible script.

Even though Rickson is probably the strongest Gracie in terms of physical and technical abilities, the family chose Royce to compete in UFC to demonstrate that a physically small person can defeat much larger opponents using superior grappling techniques.If you're a fan of MMA, this is a good DVD to watch to see how competition has evolved over the years.\n",

Much of the material is well-presented, but too many words are used in the exercises (and in the dialogues of each lesson) that do not turn up in the glossary in the back. I find the book really heavy going even with a dictionary. Some of the grammatical explanations are good, but there are many idiomatic usages in the lessons and no real guidance of how to use them. Even after working through the book and tapes I don't feel at all confident in even simple conversation. Coverage of phonics is very skimply and the differences between different phonemes are not explained. The recorded dialogues on the tapes are spoken very fast and are extremely difficult to follow. I feel that the author could have used much more input from would-be users- a book that purports to be a \"teach yourself book\" should be much more self-contained. It should not be necessary so often for the user of it to have to consult outside references.\n",

I can agree wholeheartedly that his childhood is worse than that of Christina Crawford's 'Mommie Dearest', and that his father will have so much to account for on judgement day for the nightmare he put all of his children through.

I would have given the title 5 stars if it had gone into greater depth on some of the subjects, but hey...it is 100 of the World's Greatest Mysteries, they've got a lot of ground to cover here. This is not an in depth exploration of life's deeper meanings. This IS a brief telling of great mysteries that skips, like a rock on still water, from subject to subject. Purely entertaining, light reading, and a truly enjoyable vacation for the mind. Enjoy...\n",

      "__label__2 A lesson in improvisation: I remember reading a review of some posthumous Hendrix that stated \"latter Hendrix is only for the staunchest\". I disagree and this disc proves it. Hendrix in his last year or so really started exploring the guitar.He was not sitting still... He was getting into jazz, jamming with Miles, Roland Kirk, etc. - ready for the next step.I'm old enough to remember how boring the jazz-rock scene was in the 70s, but if Hendrix had lived he might have taken it to new (non-boring)levels.I love the improvisations on this disc. - dash of flamenco here, some Wes Montgomery there - wonderful stuff. Yes, he was exhausted, but hell I wish I could play like that when I'm fully alert! Any student of guitar and music should view this show.\n",
      "__label__1 A complete waste of time, budget and poor acting: First of all... The producers know nothing about Bogota and Colombia in general. They show Bogota as a poor tropical crap (as usual by many US producers/directors) and I'm tired of this. Bogota is a beautiful 10 million people city located at 2,700 meters over the sea level, so it's a cold weather city/metropoli and not that tiny hotter than hell town shown in the movie.Very bad acting and stupid argument and dialogs.Don't get me wrong... I was born in Canada but I live in Colombia and I liked the past movies of the series, but this one is a big garbage and I will not waste my hard earned money on this. You'll not see accurately what Colombia really is and what happens here in this nice country so I recommend not to waste money on this nastiness.\n",

The second track can also be found on the Road Trip Official Sound Track. As for the three live tracks, 'Time Bomb,' 'You,' and 'Place in the Sun,' they are from a broadcast of Rockline in Los Angeles (to the best of my knowledge). The band sounds great on the tracks, and those three tracks alone make it worth having, as they are not available on any other Buckcherry recording.\n",

After receiving it just this afternoon, and spending 15 minutes scanning through it, I have to say that TAB publishers, producer of this 3rd edition, obviously needs to clean house in their proofreading department, and the author, Joseph J. Carr needs to pay more attention to the galley proofs when they're sent out. Missing diagrams, wrong diagrams to match the diagram's text, and just plain wrong information renders this book untrustworthy, and therefore worthless.

It really should be.It isn't. The problems?The customization of characters is very limited. You get to create four cookie cutter characters. You might as well start with the pre-made characters for all the thought that goes into it. The game action is terribly slow. It takes forever to get anywhere. By the time you get through a few rooms you are so bored you can't stand it. I bought this game the day it came out and I have been trying to like it every since. I have just given up. That's $40 I will never see again. Oh well lesson learned.By the way the music is pretty good and the movement (slow as it is) is fluid and life-like.

I don't know if I can bring myself to finish this game...Like the original 1988 version of Pool of Radiance, you will waste a lot of time fighting long meaningless battles for little or no experience points.All negative aspects aside, the graphics and animations are great.

I am unfamiliar with the 3rd edition rules of D&D, but I always thought a sorcerer would get at least one spell so it must be a game flaw. I have not found one single quality in this game that would make it remotely fun to play.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. You will be better off playing Baldur's gate, BG2 or Icewind dale again.

      "__label__2 Great Product for everyone: So I bought this funny looking saddle because I had cyst on my lady parts and could no longer use a regular bike seat. No fun. This bike seat took all the pressure off said \"sensitive bits\" and is actually more comfortable in general than \"normal\" bike seats, medical problems or not. I have ridden it for about 6 months now and taken the bike out on a 5 hour trip, as well as short term city biking. Over all it is of excellent quality. Yes there are some problems with this seat. you loose the ability to steer with your legs, and on long bike rides your thighs will be a bit sore. BUT you will be less sore than you would have been on a regular seat. and your sensitive areas will be just fine.Over all I highly recommend this seat for all.\n",

      "__label__1 I really struggled with the heroine: I finished this book yesterday and even after a day I'm still irritated by the h's attitude. Again considering the time period, I found the h's attitude very 21st century. We are told constantly how 'different' her family is and how her mother just wants her to have a love match. I sincerely doubt that any parent of the day would have gone to such trouble to get their daughter alone with a young, handsome and eligible male.Inevitably the h sleeps with the H but refuses to marry him. Of course the thought of pregnancy never enters her mind (although later it does). The fact that she continually doubted the H's love for her, and he professed it quickly, and if I were him I would have found someone more deserving.I bought the trilogy, which I've put aside for now because I was so put off by Violet. I do like the author though and enjoyed The Temptation trilogy so I'll probably pick up the second book at a later date.\n",

Except for the nice cover, it looks like it was thrown together at Kinkos.What really irks me is that I paid almost $50 for this book. This is something I would pay $10 for a PDF download.\n",
      "__label__2 Would I Measure Up?: This movie had haunted me ever since I first saw it on Los Angeles TV when I was twelve years old. Being the son of a career soldier it was always expected that some day I would serve in the Army. I always wondered whether I would measure up and be able to lead men in combat.In 1991 I found myself leading a team of American soldiers advising an army in a very deadly war against a communist insurgency. Leadership in combat is the ultimate challenge and when my tour ended, I felt no different then how Richard Basehart's character did at the end of this movie.Though a bit dated, this movie is my all time favorite and definitely a keeper.\n",

      "__label__1 Korean war movie: In my opinion this was a terrible movie. It deals with a corporal (Richard Basehart) who has leadership issues, i.e. will he be able to lead if he is put in that situation. A better movie would be \"Hell is for Heroes\" which also deals with the Korean war, or \"Retreat Hell\" starring Frank Lovejoy. Don't waste your money or time on this one.\n",

I thought Godzilla becomes evil and devastates Tokyo while fighting monsters that idea is much better than the one in this movie. This is all in a boy's dream...what the heck? Now I enjoy Godzilla movies,I even liked Son of Godzilla but this movie is a disgrace. Why would Minilla be Barney and talk? What's with this bully nonsense? I wanted rubber monsters action, the only good point of this movie is Godzilla verses Gabara that's the only thing that gave this an extra star because everything else is stock footage.\n",

This movie does not have any monsters in it besides the ones in the boy's head. If you want to see a movie with cool monsters you will regret it. Now, if you're looking for the closest thing to Tellatubbies (besides Barney) this is definetly what you're looking for. This is not a Godzilla movie in the slightest.\n",
      "__label__1 Godzilla as, Barney?: Well, almost. This movie is definitly geared towards younger audiences. Most of the fight scenes are stock footage from other films, the plot is kiddy and the dubbing is worse then usual. There are two reasons to get this movie. One, if you are a Godzilla fan and want to introduce your children to the series, this is a good way to do it. This is a great way to spend some quality time with your child and maybe pass on some of what you like about the Godzilla series. The other reason? If your a collector or completionist, buy the video, watch it once and bury it on a deep shelf. Every self proclaimed Godzilla fan should have to watch this video once. It reminds us that Godzilla is for all ages. And it shows that maybe the American Godzilla wasn't that bad. After all, it could have been based on this.\n",

Robert Aldrich continually keeps things at a fast and enjoyable pace without sacrificing genious storytelling and immersive detail.

I am eagerly awaiting the following volumes.\n",
      "__label__2 Keep out a picker, but not a kicker: We still use these around the house at all entrance doors. They grasp under the door knob and plant a rubber footer on the floor. If the floor is smooth, like tile or vinyl, the footer and the floor need to be kept clean; otherwise it can slip when forced. I tried getting in once while the thing was in place and I could not do it until I really forced it for a while. I'm a big guy, but I think anyone could get past it if they were determined. Therefore, we use it as a way to keep lock pickers out, and we don't expect it to prevent someone from kicking in the door. There are other devices for that purpose, for people who live in those areas where burglaries are committed by serious career criminals. The only thing we get around here might be the wayward teen who might take something if it's easy. So, I cannot give it 5 stars; it will not keep out someone who is determined to get in. Otherwise, it is sturdy and easy to use.\n",

We live in a rental apartment and I am very scared to have people break into my home while my husband is off truck driving. First off, it is very sturdy \"looking\" but my 1 year old son was able to dislodge it from the door with little effort. My husband was also able to \"break into\" the door after losing his key to the garage by simple pushing the door back and forth twice to dislodge the device. It is good if you are paraoid but know that it doesn't really help prevent a break in, but it will buy a few seconds and alarm me to an intruder.\n",

Wheeler's text simply demonstrates the need for a Frank Netter of sorts- someone who can do for Oral Anatomy what Dr. Netter did for Gross Anatomy. I'm actually considering writing my own text one day so that future students will be able to spend more time focusing on anatomy rather than the minutia and distractions that this book is full of.

Also, there are great versions of Battle Ships, Master Mind, Connect Four, Yahtzee and Chutes and Ladders--all disquised by easily identified title variations. A fun game called Placer Racer is a family favorite.

I love this series because they are a are fun to do, combining dance, yoga, weights, and Pilates to give you a challenging full body workout that doesn't stress out your body. These tapes are set up so that if you don't have a lot of time to workout, you can just do one section and you will still sweat.

She is a gifted and elegant actress who can make a role striking and memorable. This role was beneath her to say the least.Seann William Scott is a modern comedy genuis. He has the look, the resume and the chops to take a movie to the next level. He was also probably not right for this role.

In fact, I'm certain that if anyone with lesser Hollywood standing had been in this it would never have been made.Other than a couple of funny lines delivered by supporting actor Ethan Supplee, there was nothing to laugh at. It's \"Bad Santa\" Thornton watered down to the least, while everyone else on screen is wooden and bland, in a movie so predictable that I have a hard time believing it was even written.Here's the deal: Small town boy makes good, goes home for accolades, meets mothers new boyfriend, hates mothers new boyfriend, decides he's being selfish and works to get them back together.I don't recommend buying it, I don't recommend renting it.

Things quickly become more complicated when the hazing starts anew as the gym teacher picks up where he left off...In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), while the plot and the dialogues are average and below average.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers and the poor choice of lines and weak plot.In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here... 2.4 Stars\n",

Other hats seem to work their way off during the course of the day, or migrate forward and cover his eyes. The material is soft and cozy, and we love that it isn't made in China.\n",
      "__label__2 I LOVE THIS HAT!!!: This hat didn't fit my son until he was 3 months (75% for head size) He looks like a real stud in it and gets nothing but compliments. I love the color it goes well with many of his outfits. He is now 5 months (still 75%) and the hat is getting tight and short. Other have mentioned folding the rim down to make it fit longer... I think this makes the hat look weird and disproportioned. I do wish the ears were more forward; the ears are centered on the hat, so when wearing it they are back by the crown of his head. it would look cuter to have them more towards his temples to so could see them when looking directly at him. Though you can still see them I think this would improve the look. Overall great product!\n",

      "__label__2 Terrific First Novel: Keith Scribner has written both a psychological drama and a suspense thriller in his first novel. The Goodlife, based on an actual event, begins with the kidnapping of a chemical company executive and follows the crime over a three day period. The plot unfolds through the points of view of the five main characters, moving the story forward, from different directions, to it's completion. This is a very complex, yet readable, compelling story. The writing is gritty, riveting and true to life and Mr. Scribner has a real talent for dialogue. The characters are painstakingly drawn and developed and the scenes so vivid they almost jump off the page. A tight, suspenseful, fast-paced page turner. Keith Scribner doesn't disappoint.\n",

After following the directions from this book to Kings Creek Falls, I became considerably disoriented and only found the falls after consulting with other directions from online sources. Mark Morrison's Carolina guide has much better directions, though less photographs. Online researching will also provide many, many more than the 27 Falls located in \"The Waterfalls of South Carolina.\" Check on Allen Easler's website or the Greenville Online Outdoors for more falls and, hopefully, better directions. If you just want to look at the pictures, though, this is a nice little paperback.\n",
      "__label__2 Great Value; Easy To Use: I purchased this scanner for the sole purpose of transferring old slides to a digital format. After more than a hundred scans, I have to say this is a wonderful item. It is easy to use; the software is simple. Though I have no comparison scans, the image resolution exceeds expectations (I scanned them at 1600 x 1200).A professional photographer might prefer a better model, but for home scanning and transferring personal pictures, the Canon 4400F is a great value!My family and I enjoyed seeing full-sized pictures for the first time in decades.\n",

Unfortunately, my old canoscan 1220 scanner was not compatible with this operating system so I started looking for a new one. I really liked the old one so I stuck with Canon and got the 4400. It's faster than the 1220, but is a bit bulkier, and requires its own power outlet (the 1220 was powered thru the USB). Good scanner, but if I could have kept my 1220 I would have.\n",

      "__label__2 A great idea, wonderfully executed.: I bought this album being a huge Metheny fan and it certainly lived up to my expectations. To be very honest, I was expecting something a little bit different, more in line with the stuff that Metheny plays with his group and so it took me a little time to appreciate its true beauty. But, over the last 2 weeks, the album has really grown on me. \"Nascente\" and \"Sometimes I See\" are just superb, wonderfully arranged, and with great solos. Metheny's note choice, on the whole, is exquisite as usual and so is Brecker's and Hancock's. James Taylor also sings wonderfully on his two appearances lending a distinct charm to the album. I would highly recommend this work to everyone.\n",

Numerous candidates for any \"best makeout tunes of all time\" compilations. Even James Taylor's blessings to validate the safety factor of this project. Nearness of You has all this, and less.Missing are fresh meaningful readings of the (beautiful) compositions, any hint of lyric urgency or that sense of voice that makes a jazz ballad sing.

I have never enjoyed reading about the American Civil War, however, the author was able to capture my attention in this book.

This is one of the first two that I exchanged.- All of the adjustment knobs are different, and none of them are easy to use. Some get in the way of each other when you're trying to secure it!- It's impossible to secure the rotation on the second pair I got. The first were fine. I'm guessing this is another artifact of cheap manufacturing.- All of the adjustments are either loose or very tight to rotate. Some of them go from loose to stuck in just a few degrees of rotation.- There are many more defects, but I'm getting angry just writing about this, recalling my futile attempts to get these set up.Summary: Avoid at all costs!

Is it the most challenging weight workout? No, for those, get the Jari Love DVDs. But is it a good weight workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser? Yes, if you're happy not being sore the next day. Stephanie is a good cuer and leader; her voice is well modulated, and not too peppy. You will need an incline box (I would recommend the transfirmer over the incline box), and 5-12 pound dumbbells. Why not 5 stars? The ab work.

(I checked elsewhere to make sure that the capital had not moved from Montgomery.) If this basic information is incorrect, it makes me wonder how many other errors exist, and if I can trust only the information that I know from other sources. Very disappointing!\n",

      "__label__1 Good acting, but very boring!!!: If you're looking for a suspenseful movie, don't look here. The acting is good, but there is no suspense because it's slow character driven drama that is base on murder that doesn't unfolds until the very end of the movie.\n",
      "__label__1 Slow, Dull: The fact that it's a true story makes it interesting alone - but the plot line, the music, the build us is unfortunately off in a variety of ways. I really wanted to like this movie, but didnt. As a movie, it just falls short. The characters needed a bit more development and the casting was just not as good as it could have been. Kristen Dunst does a good job - but really the movie (and story) is bizarre, so even her acting couldnt pull this movie out.\n",

It never did. I have Amazon Prime so I'm not out any money, but I did waste my time.\n",
      "__label__1 Unable to care about the characters: While others see Gosling as having done a great job, my own response is that he did, if what he was going for was boring. His character should have been interesting. Instead I found it so boring that it was impossible for me to believe in Dunst's devotion to him. As a result I didn't care about any of the characters. I found the movie long, boring, and disjointed.\n",

The entire CD ONLY HAD 3 games on it - one video poker machine and two slot machines. No wonder it only took about 30 seconds to install! This CD has more film clips and adds pushing a trip to Vegas, than it has the actual games themselves. Do yourself a favor - do not order this product.\n",

Her music is not essential, but if you are into 1960's French music it's not all that bad. There are some great songs on this disc, not really worth buying the whole album, but still a fun listen.\n",

As a result, I threw them in the trash.The worst thing that happened after this purchase was when I received and email from Amazon Market Place asking me to rate this order and the seller, so I wrote exactly what I mentioned above, the next day I received an email from the seller who insisted that it was my mistake because I ordered stickers with white letters not red and that I needed them for my PC not for my mac! plus, the way that the seller has wrote their email to me was very rude and I saved their email.

I kept the same video card, DVD & CDRW drives, etc. I reloaded Windows 2000, loaded the software/drivers, and nothing happened.After trying for a week, I gave up.

The scanner tends to scan images a bit dark, but that is easily corrected with the included imaging software (I actually use PaintShop Pro to adjust the brightness). The OCR (OmniPage LE)does a fairly good job, but free OCR software will never be the match of $100.00 programs. I scan images almost exclusively for posting to websites. The scans are fairly quick, even with the 30-second warm-up for the first scan. You get quite a bit of bundled software, some of which is redundant (how many graphics programs do you really need?). I use the copy utility much more than I thought I ever would. I even put a shortcut of the Copier on the desktop so I can copy quickly. In short, this is a pretty good scanner with some decent included software and a great USB interface!\n",

      "__label__2 Spirtitual Inadequacy and Redemption: I really enjoyed Strout's earlier novel, AMY AND ISABELLE, so when this book came out (seven years later!), I was willing to give it a read, sight unseen.ABIDE WITH ME is a testament to Strout's skills. She manages to get an avowed secular humanist (me!) to dive deeply into this portrait of a Congregational minister and father who is in deep mourning for his wife. Feeling that his travails are minor compared to the losses that others throughout history have faced, he starts to lose faith in himself. Eventually, his daughters and congregation also begin to lose their faith in him as well.Although the book deals with inner turmoil, there is a lot of dryly spun New England humor in it as well, a leavening that makes for a very satisfying prose mixture. I just hope that I don't have to wait another seven years for Strout's next gem of a novel.\n",

The latest edition of The New Yorker gave a very favorable review of this book. But for me, I don't know that this was the worst book I've read in the last few months, but it came close. I couldn't have been less interested in the characters, the subject matter, the location - the whole book left me cold. I have read comparisons to Gilead - a wonderful book. Abide with Me is not in the same league, not even playing the same game.\n",

Brad Knight speculates on what he felt like happened to Laci, and why Scott did it, etc. I don't care what he \"speculates\" happened to Laci, I want facts and there wasn't any given in this book. He then goes on to bore us about his take on the O.J. Simpson murder case (as if this has anything to do with the Peterson case-don't ask.) He rambles on and on about his theories on both of these cases, but his theories are based on speculation, rumors, etc. The fact the title of the book is \"Laci Peterson: The Whole Story\" is a joke...the book ends even before the trial. He is supposedly going to write a second book to finish where the first book ended...boy, that's one book I won't be buying. If you want to read the definitive book on the Laci Peterson murder case read Catherine Crier's great book, \"A Deadly Game\".\n",

I paid around $30.00 for this book and couldn't even finish it! The author included all these personal stories about himself, that had nothing to do with the case at all! There were so many stories about himself, that I found myself skipping through the book, just trying to find content about the actual case. I finally said enough, and put it away for good. I let my aunt have it, and she only got through the second chapter. My advice is to save your money.\n",

You never really discover what motivated certain main characters to behave the way they did, or why. You also never find out what happened to certain characters, they are just dropped. I also expected a book that involved werewolves throughout, although that too left me disappointed. The worst of it was all the type o's I found.

The werewolf is perhaps one of those classic monsters most rich with symbolic possibilities, and Lee employs here an interesting conceit.

I'm quite disappointed in the lack of quality, not the performance. The materials they use are cheap... some rubber and thin metal wire.

They are easy to slip on over my riding boots, and I feel secure enough to fetch the horse from the paddock, as well as make trips between my car and the barn. When I am done, I can slip the YakTrax off, rinse them off when I clean my boots, and they are ready for the next use. I had already fallen flat on my back earlier this winter, so it was a great relief to get the YakTrax so promptly after ordering them.\n",

She was someone I thought was a friend, pumping me for information which she fed back to the 'Queen Bee'. It also helped me recognize who the Afraid-to-Bees were and cut them all off.

Rapaille comes across as an elitist who's tricked everyone into believing he's a guru. I would compare Rapaille to some know-it-all 'expert' at the art gallery who raves about the artist's use of light, color, and internal meaning, only to find out later that the painting was done by an elephant with a brush in its trunk (i.e. waaaay too much meaning assigned to random things). The same is true here. Rapaille's conclusions are ambiguous and unproveable, and you or I could spout the same arbitrary theories. For example, because Americans consume a lot of hamburgers, I hereby declare that the culture code for America is a cow. See? It's easy. This type of random link between unrelated things (and the unsupportable claim that they're not random and they ARE related)is what you get with this book. Rapaille's only genius is in convincing corporate America that he is one.\n",

One of the worst albums of the year. The covers throw rotten eggs at the original versions, and the stench seeps through the rest of the songs. The music is terrible, the songwriting is terrible, their voices aren't anything to write home about, and the lyrics are downright pathetic. Why buy it? Don't, boycott it!

The story and script was not over the top and non-exploitive, and it did capture a slice and time of American history/culture (the post WWII America 1950's) when life seemed tame, safe, and somewhat boring? It was nice to see when contemporary America at the time had these slight aberrations of slight deviant behavior simmering underneath the country, questioning decency and morals in society, right before the 60's counter-culture was about to emerge. Overall, a great cast, decent script and cinematography (capturing the look and feel of the 1950's), and the beautiful Gretchen Mol capturing the look and spirit of the queen of the golden age of pin-up girls.\n",

Anyway, I had to buy this book because she stops reading when Sasha opens the door to the bedroom with surpise then all hell breaks loose.

It is with wonder that the producer of the album did not take the time to either suggest more work on the vocals, as oftentimes the vocalist is unable to reach a solid note, or to completely redo various tracks to \"cover up\" the lack of strength and range. A typical album, typical genre of low grade music styling, and just overall typical. Not one of my favourites but everyone wants to be a star, eh?\n",

The first one broke at the handle where the button is and stopped working altogethe. It would start up and then turn off randomly so it could never complete a heating cycle. It lasted for 6 months to a year. The second one I got as a replacement broke at joint where the lid attaches to the top so it just falls off when pouring (unless you want to hold it in place and burn your hand periodically). Yesterday it started leaking between the black base and bottom of the glass. After hearing reviews of their customer service, I haven't bothered to complain about a replacement. I am looking for an alternative. I liked the product otherwise. It's a shame it's so cheaply or badly made.\n",

The pot is attractive and heats quickly which are great selling features, but the taste doesn't let up after over a year of use.

The handle was broken in the first couple of months, the lid no longer is attached by the hinge, and the power switch is not functioning very well any more.

All the while, encouraging a family unit as well as independent growth.The plot was intriguing and kept the reader guessing as to which one was the main topic. Definately a summer read!The only way to improve this book would be to offer a little bit more history about the supporting characters.

      "__label__2 Awesome Cover for my S410 camera: This cover is absolutly the best for my S410, perfectly fits my s410 and protects from scratches (Leather is pretty thick - better than i expected), people may complain about no additional pockets, but i dont see the necessacity for additional pockets for s410 or s500 cameras, i have 512 MB CF card which can hold over 300 pictures. and battery lasts practically forever, i still had charge left in the battery after 2 days of continues use and after taking about 200 pictures (more than 100 with flash). for the people looking for case with some additional pockets, they can look at some generic cases but the bulkiness of the case defeats the whole purpose of compact camera.\n",
      "__label__2 Nice match for the camera.: For under $10, this item should have come with the camera. I bought my Canon S230 and put it in an old \"Spectralink\" phone case. That really protected the camera and fit well, but just didn't look great. Then I bought my wife the SD200 camera at [...] and the case for the SD200 here at Amazon. The cases completed the cameras. I am left with the more bulky older model and my wife got the SD200. But we both have an interesting set, mine in black, hers in red. For these prices I wouldn't invest in some 3rd party case. Get the genuine Canon case for your camera even if Canon doesn't provide it.\n",
      "__label__1 GOOD SEVICE TILL NOW: IVE HAD GOOD SEVICE FROM AMAZON.COM TILL NOW JAN.7 7:53PM CST.I WAS PROMISED I WOULD HAVE MY PSC-50 BY TODAY STILL NO PRODUCT.WHEN I FIND OUT WHOM IT WAS COMING FROM I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW TO LET YOU KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM SO YOU CAN BE CAUTIOUS OF THEM.SAD TO BE WRITING THIS REVIEW.ORDER WAS PLACED ON DEC. 25.I KNOW TIME IS ALLOWED FOR THE HOLIDAYS BUT GIVE ME A BREAK.

I LIKE THE BELT LOOP INSTEAD OF A CLIP LIKE A PAGER BECAUSE IVE HAD PAGERS FALL OFF & BREAK.I SEE AMAZON DESNT CARRY THIS PRODUCT ANYMORE.YOU HAVE TO GET SOME WHERE ELSE.\n",
      "__label__1 very loose: the color was acceptable, however the size was not fit enough. Therefore, the camera case will look not elegant as I thought.\n",
      "__label__2 Nice cheap phone sys: Perfect for a small business that doesn't need conference calling.Price was great, works well. Looks very nice too.Very pleased.\n",
      "__label__1 For high school graduates: Respectable publisher, respectable series. I was expecting presentation level, scope and depth similar to Eberly's \"Game Physics\". Unfortunately, mistake. This is a book for someone who just graduated from American high school and knows only so called \"algebra\" (+, -, *, / with calculator, no fractions). No question, there are such individuals, they have to learn, and for them this is pretty good book. I was fooled by impressive Table of Contents and number of pages. Was useless for me. Lesson learned: if you want Eberly's quality, buy Eberly's books\n",
      "__label__2 Good for laughs: I love this show. I was so excited when they were putting it out on DVD because I thought all I had were memories. That being said, I too was very disappointed in Lionsgate for putting episodes in Season four that were already in Season Three. Like none of us would notice? I highly recommend purchasing the DVD set anyway because ALF will always be great TV, just don't be disappointed if you get part way into an episode and say \"I've seen this already...\" and it's not because you recently watched it on actual TV.\n",
      "__label__2 Daily serving of fruit: Nice chunks of dried pineapple. Not crazy about the sugary coating on the outside but I suppose that is to keep them from sticking together.\n",
      "__label__2 Old Master - A Great Disc: Robert Johnson was the inspiration for generations of blues singers and blues lovers. It seems a great surprise to many that he was also the inspiration for waves of British performers who covered his songs: The Stones, Cream, Led Zep, Eric Clapton, etc., etc.So it's particularly interesting to listen to this disc and hear the power of the original - and remastered to offer sound quality which far exceeds my old scratched records.A definite buy for anyone who loves the blues.\n",
      "__label__2 I like it.: I'm giving this CD five stars out of five, and here's why. First off, I like how Chevelle stuck to their style with this album instead of changing it up like most bands do with their sophmore albums (if anyone has listened to Jimmy Eat World's new album, you'll know what I'm talking about.) I also like how the sound transitions from heavy to smoothe throughout the songs. Some bands have trouble pulling off those types of transitions, but I think Chevelle did a good job of it on this album. I was already a Chevelle fan after their first CD, and this CD does nothing to hurt that status.\n",
      "__label__1 Might as Well be a Single!: i give Chevelle's new album \"This Kind of Thinking Could do Us In\" a 1 for the 1 good song on it...\"Vitamin R\". Buy the single before you make a mistake of buying this album, cause the other tracks on this cd are junk...a 1 out of 5, TERRIBLE!!!\n",
      "__label__1 Just wasn't good: Having bought this book based on the review above, i wanted to like this book but it was in no way a page turner. I forced myself to read it and found most of it vapid and inconsequential. There really is no plot so much as conveyances of saratoga scenery from one sex scene to another. I found myself skipping entire chapters and not being lost in the \"plot\" because of it which says to me that much of the writing was just filler. Many of the characters actions and reactions to different situations just didn't ring true and then of a sudden the book just kind of ends. It sounds like i'm being uncommonly harsh but having just finished two historical page turners in a row my disappointment with this book grows. I only give it the second star because i actually finished it.\n",
      "__label__2 makes great popcorn: Very easy and fast to use. I have a gas stove and have had no problem making popcorn on medium heat. I have used the butter flavored oil for added flavor. I look forward to taking this camping this summer.\n",
      "__label__1 great idea - but not in aluminum!: We love the idea of this popper, and used it at least once a week for a year. It worked great, but when it developed a pinhole in the bottom, right in the center, and oil started to seep out onto the hot burner, we got weary. And then when it started a small fire on the burner, we threw it out. We'll be replacing it with a stainless steel model (which means it will have to be a different brand).\n",
      "__label__2 Great popcorn popper! We love it.: We bought this popcorn popper to use for our son's birthday party and on boy scout camp outs but have been using it at least once a week at home since we got it in August.\n",
      "__label__1 Whirly Pop could be so much better: We received a Whirley Pop as a Christmas gift, and love it, but the construction is very cheap. As a previous reviewer wrote - because the pot is so thin, it deforms after some use. This item would get a 4 if the pot were made of better materials - 5 if the lid would clip on and off a bit easier. A shame since the popcorn is so good!\n",
      "__label__1 Broke after first use!: The first time I was making popcorn the plastic gear on the top completely shredded when turning the handle to keep from burning-yeah it burnt! Couldn't turn and threw away the popcorn and the popper! Should've lasted longer, it would've been a nice popper.\n",
      "__label__1 Shoddy and unsafe: I bought 2 poppers, one for myself and one for a gift. I used mine about 3 times and noticed that one of the little wooden knobs had fallen off. I searched for 10 minutes and found one sharp screw pin in my popcorn. I never found the other pin so maybe we ate it. I sent both back as I dont want my granddaughter to swallow a metal pin. I was so dissappointed since now I have to come up with another gift at the last minute.\n",
      "__label__1 BIASED REVIEWS: I was interested in purchasing this popcorn maker as part of a gift set. However, when reading the reviews on Amazon.com I realized a serious problem. The reviews are biased. Look through the 79+ reviews. You'll see the majority of the reviews give the product a full 5 stars (which is extremely surprising considering most reviewers are finicky), are written in the same tone/style of writing, and say what a wonderful gift this would make. Many also mention that it's the best popcorn ever and they've used it for several years. Some even venture to say it only works well only if you use Wabash popcorn.If you read reviews less than 5 stars you'll see all writers say this gadget broke/melted within a couple months. There is a serious bias in these reviews and I hope consumers are not being taken advantage of. Some of the high reviews may be valid but I'm quite certain nearly all are false...I've decided not to purchase the item.\n",
      "__label__1 Construction could be a LOT better.....: The Whirley-Pop model we bought is different from the one shown---the gears are PLASTIC--bad idea #1--and the handle is plastic and set very close to the pot...bad idea #2.The lid stayed on for the first 2-3 uses, then just failed. It's almost impossible to handle piping-hot oil and attempt to keep the lid on. I consider it a definite hazard. The handle on our model is built so that one's hand is directly over the stove burner. Add attempts at controlling the entire contraption with oven mitts and you have a recipe for disaster. I'm too afraid to wrestle with it again--I'm afraid I'll burn myself.Which is a shame, because the popper really makes excellent popcorn. I'd buy another one if it were better-constructed and had METAL GEARS.\n",
      "__label__1 Don't buy this piece of ####: It was a great idea, it's a shame a good company didn't make it, can't even blame it on foreigners. This piece of crap is a rip off. I did't know you could make a pot out of tin foil, calling it flimsy would be a compliment. As soon as you assemble it and turn the handle once to see how it works, you've made a dimple in the bottom of the pot and best of all you can press it back into shape with your fingernail and no effort. The plastic gearing for the turning handle might last 4 or 5 uses. The only thing that was well made was the wooden handle. I guess they were out of balsa wood that day.DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Save your money for good popcorn at the theatre.\n",
      "__label__2 Way better than microwave popcorn: The WhirleyPop makes great tasting popcorn, really quickly. It's not much more trouble than microwave popcorn in about the same amount of time, and the results are *far* superior to microwave. It's also a lot of fun to use!\n",
      "__label__1 not sturdy enough: The plastic gears on these poppers do not grip to the metal post/crank and slip. Any resistance results in the user turning the handle but no movement within the popper. Worked great for first year of average or less use but now, pretty intermittant and a really, more pain than worth. I only continue to use it to keep oil buildup off of other pans. We shake, not crank, now. Won't buy another as it's unfortunately yet another disposable product that overloads landfills.\n",
      "__label__2 Even works will cooking spray! Toasts other items (inca corn): I really love this thing. Someone was giving one away, and I was surprised to see it on amazon! I love mine. I actually gave away my microwave popcorn popper because I ave this. I feel better eating something not microwaved, and it is just as fast! I toasted that inca corn with it. It came out great! Much lower in calories than if I fried it like the packet said. I dont even pour oil, I just use oil spray (try a misto! That would be best). When you pop with no oil, just spray a little oil spray on the popcorn afterward, to make salt stick.\n",
      "__label__2 Good Eatin'!: I love this popper!! It is a fun and easy way to have a healthy and delicious snack. I purchased it two years ago and have eaten microwave popcorn only ONCE since then. Yuck! Once you prepare your popcorn with the Whirley-Popper, you will not want another bag of nuked popcorn ever again.\n",
      "__label__1 Something is wrong here: I agree with a previous review---something about the accolades is biased here (consider the repeating phrases).This does not produce great popcorn. I bought the unit with the special Wabash popcorn pouches touted to have won awards. I have used several, and the popcorn is not crisp, but is chewy, not particularly special in flavor, and full of saturated fat because of the coconut oil blend in the pouches.The unit is flimsy, prone to bending, and IMO does not produce popcorn as good as Popsecret Homestyle or Orville's Movie Theater microwave popcorn.Avoid this item! Within weeks I had to dispose of it.\n",
      "__label__2 Best popcorn: This makes the best popcorn I've had and with only a teaspoon or so of oil.I have used mine for about 10 years but I think it is time for it to be replaced. It only has one small dent and a nice \"patina\" on the inside but the gears are finally giving out. I have a new one that I had bought for gift-giving purposes but I think it will be staying with me while the old one is \"retired.\"I have more than gotten mine money's worth although now I am spoiled and won't eat microwave popcorn any more.\n",
      "__label__1 WhirlyPop popper is kinda cheezy: Inexpensive, but IMO pretty poorly constructed. The idea is good (pop all the kernels --- and it does that) but it is poorly put together with barely marginal parts that slip and so ultimately we just tossed it and went back to the old pot. Cannot recommend to buy.\n",
      "__label__2 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper: Product works fine although it looks fragile, pay attention to instructions, use med-high heat for popping and turn crank slowly, great with white pop corn as well as yellow. Easy clean up.Would not recommend theater type popcorn initially supplieds\n",
      "__label__2 whirley Pop: We love this, popcorn cooks real nice and fluffy in this pan easy to use. hand crank is easy to use and located in a easy to reach place.\n",
      "__label__1 not impressed: this takes up too much cabinet space for it's usefulness. i much prefer my hotair popper. it is awkward to hold on to and if you use some of their crazy recipes that include sugar or other sticky ingredients, it is a pain to clean.i really do not care for this item.\n",
      "__label__1 Gear mechanism broke after about 5 uses.: This popper made terrific tasting popcorn, but the turning gearmechanism on the top of the pan is made of plastic, and broke afterI used the pan about 5 times. The pan heats up very hot, and theplatic is a poor choice to use in the turning mechanism.They should of used metal.\n",
      "__label__2 Remind me of my childhood!: I gave this to my 76 year old grandmother for a gift because she can not use the microwave due to a pacemaker. She loved it and is always making popcorn now. The popcorn that came with it was the best popcorn we ever tasted. The only problem she has is that it is hard to use when she is having problems with her hands. She says \"I love it no matter if my hand hurts!\" LOL\n",
      "__label__2 best popcorn popper ever: I have used several poppers, auto, air etc.. This is the best! Yes, you have to stand over it for 3 to 4 minutes but it pops almost every kernel. I have used the cheapest corn and the best-same results. You have to follow the instructions otherwise you will writing a negative review. It works as designed! I would buy this again or as a gift for anybody!\n",
      "__label__2 Great Product!: This is the one I had originally for over a year till it fell off the top of the fridge and the lid broke. Very sad for us because we love popcorn! I tried a different version of a different brand from Fleet Farm and that one was terrible! Whirley-Pop is the way to go!\n",
      "__label__2 Electric blue!: I'm a HUGE fan of SFX - it goes on well and has staying power. The colors stay bright after repeated washing and they don't bleed on to everything. Love this shade for a bright blue.\n",
      "__label__2 Study-worthy.: I found this in an effort to lead a Women's study on women in ministry. I had dug long and hard to find a concise review of various impacting Christian-women's tales all in one place. It is hard to find Christian women biographies - esp of Living women. I appreciate the author's research (and that she narrowed to 12 women, when she interviewed many more).Each chapter is a very brief overview of each woman, but it shows us Christian women who are all over world and most are still ALIVE! In our study, we've noticed how powerfully God uses women - in many different ways, in all countries. Each woman in book seems to start small, ask God for guidance, then He helps them see more of His Big vision and we see how they act on it.Not amazingly written, and each bio may bring up more questions than it answers, but it's a start for world-perspective on being a Christian.\n",

      "label the backup plan summer reading that does not require much from the reader i found the plot unbelievable would a guy wait for you for years they had not even kept in touch as friends the romance was too predictable and treatment for ptsd is a far cry from what was described in this story i skimmed through a good part of this book just to say i finished it it simply did not hold my interest label would not work with verizon card i tried to get two of these to work with the verizon pc5750 card without success even after updating the software i ended up buying the linksyswireless-g router for mobile broadband wrt54g3g-vn which works well and was priced less the linksys did require a software update from the linksys website label a profound journey lumari s book akashic records opened a new way for me to connect with greater wisdom i immediately felt i was listening to a more intimate conversation with the keepers of the akashic while some books try to explain how to access information from the akashic lumari speaks about the collective itself in this way i could feel the energies of the collective and how they perceive the universe and how they gather the information of life i felt like i was invited into the akashic to listen to learn and to understand this book is very interesting and opens a whole new conversation that brought deeper meaning and possibility into my own awareness the energy quality of this book is excellent the meditation in this book is a profound journey into greater wisdom and spirit i highly recommend this book and lumari s other book alawashka too label no relief the product information says that it takes at least days for this product to work at days i was still removing at least fleas from my dog per day the same as before i started using flea away i can t believe that more days would have made any difference and although the many high-dose b vitamins in the tablets are water soluble i e if the dog gets more than she needs her body will get rid of it without toxicity the vitamin e is not water soluble vitamin e can increase bleeding risk and i was a bit worried about my little dog receiving too much of this vitamin i stopped the pills at days with no relief in sight label good for fur bad for keping fleas off the product did make my pets fur softer but did nothing as far as a flea repellent label alterate time-line for the marvel mob niel gaiman has created some amazing illustrated fiction the kind that combines literate storytelling with masterful artwork i regret that is not part of that ouvre if you re a dedicated fan of the x-men nick fury drs strange and doom the fantastic four and marvel s other standards you may well enjoy seeing them all transplanted into the early seventeenth century i m afraid that i outgrew my interest in those characters some time back for me this looked less like an exploration of the comic medium and more like a mechanical attempt to inject novelty into franchises that desperately need it if the usual marvel crowd holds your attention then go ahead enjoy you ll probably find a lot to like here my interests have moved on wiredweird label no better graphic novel for fans of marvel and history by placing some of the best loved marvel heroes into a historic setting gaiman has crafted not only a work of art but also a wonderful playground for some familiar faces to play within i ll admit as a neil gaiman fan and as a marvel fan i was predestined to like this work if you are either of these things this is a no-brainer purchase but even if you are a casual comic fan or simply a fan of good stories this will be an excellent read and well worth the cover price it would be difficult to review specifics without ruining something suffice to say some of the best moments come from what would be considered normal events in the marvel universe and how they are interpreted for the th century i should also mention the artwork is incredible and on par with current comic masterpieces if all you know is the art that appeared in comics in the eighties you will relish in this advancement label work but with some effort the plastic material is too stiff i have to put a little more work to get them fit on the cans label i didn t buy these note to those looking i actually bought petking lids four pack in colors with paws and tabs on ebay the answer i was looking for was no where to be found petking lids said they fit oz and oz cans which was also no help when i needed them for oz cat food cans but i did find someone to tell me that the lids i bought fit cans which is the oz size so if you are looking for lids for cat food in the oz size petking can covers will work label whoah this is my favorite movie it is so awesome the fire is really cool the sound is better and the band just rocks for all you people who are afraid to buy the video bcuz of the buck dich scene i must say i am straight and the buck dich thing was the funniest i ever saw i was laughing for a week so buy it already u wont regret it label rammstein rocks never saw rammstein in whole concert before only thier videos and one live concert clip where they did some pretty crazy things so i was suprised when i saw this it was more toned down than i was expecting but still pretty cool with thier flame throwers and pyrotechnics i dont speak or know that much german but even though i dont know everthing they are saying it still rocked heres a review of the songs speil mit fir stars out of herzeleid out of bestrafe mich out of

of metal label read professor sherwood s vindication a novel in my opinion a better conceptualization of mary wollstonecraft slife ideas and experinences is author frances sherwoodtile vindication however the gordon book is an adequate read label good resource i don t actually own this book but i took it out from the library and enjoyed reading it the author who lived in angola for several years did a good job of explaining the history of angola and its people from the first contact with the portuguese up until the independence the book explains many of the conflicts angola has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of colonialism ethnolinguistic clashes and the conflict of african and european nationalisms a good resource for information on how the april movement in portugal related to the independence of angola label whimsical life with father set in tuscany frank schaeffer is great i realize many think the book is an unfair jab at his family but speaking from an objective standpoint the book is damn funny i grew up in a similar situation though much less tragic in northeastern italy and schaeffer s depiction of the italian coastal town is beautiful he correctly identifies the struggles and interchanges that take place in a fundamentalist christian home overseas i do not think i have read a more accurate depiction of being thirteen in a missionary family in italy and in love it was a great read label ugly shoes these shoes are comfortable at first but after four hours of dancing my feet were hurting me i cant even walk they are not as cute as the picture either i was going to return it the first time it came but i dont have the time its really ugly my husband said no no return it label not too great i personally think there was only one really hot woman in the entire thing so much for my expectations label good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good label fantastic book i am currently engaged and planning to be married very soon and soon after hope to have children of my own this is a very inspiring book that gives you a lot to think about on how you might want to raise you kids it goes through some of her experiences and teaches lesson along the way great laughs i have never taken the time to write a review before but this one is worth it label sounds more like l a metal the track wanted man sure sound like an l a hair metal act listen to those vocals they sound much better on thunderstruck riding free which is more in the vein of euro-metal don t be fooled by their denmark stamp label bad bad bad i had never read a walter kirn book before and saw this one at a local bookstore and it looked interesting and it seemed interesting based on what i read standing there when i got home and started reading it i was very disappointed i was so confused and upset because of my confusion that i had a real hard time reading this book after i finished it i said that is the worst book i have ever read please don t waste your time or money label nothingness i wasted rambling writing going nowhere expect to see this book as a prop in bookcases at discount furniture stores and in new model homes if you happen to see the movie it s obvious the screenwriter s didn t think much of it either the plot is similar to the book in only the broadest sense the author probably doesn t care how his novel was adapted for the popularity of the movie has likely attracted more suckers like me to buy the book label platinum disappointment up in the air is perhaps the best written awful book i ve ever read walter kirn assembles words well and he s an astute observer of some aspects of frequent traveling but the story never reaches a comfortable cruising altitude there s nothing likeable about ryan bingham his seatmates the woman he occasionally sleeps with or the family he grew up with the several weak plots badly woven throughout the book made me feel like i was sitting on a plane overhearing parts of several conversations none of which i cared about as it droned on like the engine of a it was clear the book had no flight plan a few pages of this sad cynical tale might have made a good essay maybe a few pages more could have been spun into a readable short story but a novel it s not and the tired little book certainly isn t worthy of all the publicity it s receiving label smug and tedious novel like many other reviewers i saw the movie first liked it and was interested in reading the book what a disappointment i found it pretentious and boring i wasn t interested in any of the characters all of whom blended for me since they spoke in the same forced dialogue the whole book felt like the author was showing off but to no effect i think you could read something like twilight times and it wouldn t get as boring as this novel the first time label dark forces good mysteries of sith bad the dark forces may be the best first-person action video game but it gets marred by mos it was too easy to kill myself in mos simply by force jumping i died a hundred times because there was something overhead when i jumped once i died because i jumped straight up but took damage from the fall another time i was on this ledge and couldn t get back upevery time i jumped i would bounce off the wall and die when i went to several web sites to get help on how to get off that ledge the best that i could find was it is tricky to get off the ledge after dying several hundred times i got bored and quit i ve never gone back label wild about this book i love this book and my son loves this book but i probably love it more the librarian accidently drives the bookmobile into the zoo and before you know it the animals are reading the rhythm flows nicely and it s clever and the pictures are charming big thumbs up label great book for ages we read this for my daughter s kindergarten book club it was so cute what a great way to get kids excited about reading the references to great classic children s book and literature enriches an already fun story kids will love to see how the animals at the zoo take to reading very cute label do the job very well these barstools are an excellent value for the price easy to set up and they sit very well we have them for weeks now and use them a lot label flawless this book is worth the it describes the concepts perfectly concisely for the intermediate advanced student of spanish to the language s nuances without causing the reader to reach for the dictionary several times over one page it reviews how where consonants are pronounced vowel sounds accentuation plenty of definitions sonoridad vs sorda espirantizacion lenicion etc within the first two chapters the following chapters address la formacion verbal la formacion nominal y adjetival formacion pronomial el lexico diferencias semanticas tiempos verbales y los modos verbales indicativo y subjuntivo whether you re a seasoned veteran with spanish or still learning this book is the best on the market regardless of it being older than a few others the one drawback is that it does not use international phonetic symbols but anyone with some light familiarity with the international symbols will be able to crack this book in no time label well researched my wife and i helped rob with some of the research for the book while we were living on the island of raiatea in most travel writers can only spend a little time actually checking out places to stay and eat with the research that we were able to do the reader of this book can be assured that the information hotels pensions and restaurants on huahine raiatea tahaa and maupiti are not only accurate but informed by our personal experiences during a stay of several months label yummy pictures unreliable recipes i finally got the book after waiting for a month the food in the photos all looked so delicious that it made me drool i was eager to try out the recipes and i thought i start with the raddish cake to my horror the instructions were unclear the author did not mention what to do with the raddish luckily i had another book which has a perfect recipe for it a few days later i thought i try the crystal duck dumplings and although i followed the instructions perfectly the dough did not turn out well at all i think it would be a long time before i would ever try any of the recipes again maybe i am just not good at making dim sum label i llllloooooovvveeeeeeeee this book and i am i love to read long books and novels but i have to say even though this book is for ages i love this book and i am so whho really cares how long it is this is a ssupense filled awsome that you will love love love love love love times label i certainly didn t see that coming i don t read much fiction so when i find a book i that really holds my attention like temporary sanity did i take special note the whole book was woven together very well i enjoyed each character even the ones who were created especially so we would be frustrated with them marty is very likeable as the able and highly intuitive defense attorney with a heart i can imagine the small firm she works in is actually a positive place to hang your hat this must be fiction smiling not only is the writing thoroughly engaging and entertaining the subject matter is one we can all relate to in all its horrifying glory what worked especially well was the ending i had no clue what was coming i love when i am taken by surprise like this kudos to rose connors for pulling off such a delightful conclusion label mischaracterised internal page conditions purchased used very good former library book stated as one of best former library books book s outside was good not very good the inside pages were smeared with dried debris foods markings etc worst used book i ever bought label brilliant yet readible a masterfully written origins of tantric sexual practicewritten by a professor who does not place himself above his readers a well researched technical history label almost the first thing that one must say when reviewing legally blond is that the screenwriter s for the movie are more talented the ms brown i liked the book on some levels the plot kept me interested but the writing was not exactly wonderful at the first page i realized this and wondered if it would be the same the whole way through it was the only way to describe the writing is as slightly childish even though parts of it were good i could not recommend it to all those reading this who loved the book sorry i always get really angry when someone bashes a book i loved label wonderful book a treasure i absolutely love this book about my parents home anyone interested in history and legends should get this book label could have been better this was an interesting book the writing and editing weren t really that great but i was expecting a bit more substance the author gave an overview of mercenary operations over an extended period of history and then gave relatively short shrift to current operations particulalry in iraq where pmc s private military companies are making sinful amounts of money out of the ongoing debacle in iraq the author doesn t appear to have an agenda with this book other than to get published and make money the sad thing is that with a little more homework and fact checking he could have done something special label hack job this book is poorly researched and in my opinion poorly written you would think that because of fred rosen s background as an investigative reporter he would have done an in depth investigation of his subject matter this is not the case his retelling of the war in angola is so full of errors and omissions that i don t know why he bothered mr rosen next time leave it to anthony mockler label quicken forces users to upgrade very dissatisfied intuit forces users to upgrade software to retain the existing service levels this is due to their discontinuation policy which ironically will force me to discontinue being their customer i will not upgrade label worst version of quicken ever i have used quicken since the dos versions this one is the worst you cannot change any colors period end of discussion you cannot remove unused useless toolbars frames period end of discussion you will have to call tech support you will have to endure repeated uninstalls reinstalls download a trial version before you upgrade if you can t configure it the way you want delete it and move on label excellent game good graphics good plot decent puzzles i pull it out every few months and go through the whole thing again it never gets boring the extra missions that can be downloaded from lucasarts are really good too label fun but could be better this game is a great game for people who enjoy basic blast the bad guys into oblivion setup the levels are intriguing and all very unique but some can get very boring after a while of running around trying to find some hidden door that does nothing other than allow you to get to the next level but there are good aspects to the game such as i think different types of weapons to choose from along with great and funny sounds to go along with them buy it if you like but beware there are a lot of time wasting stages to go through so if you are buying for pure enjoyment and not time wasting be carefulget some cheats to let you skip levels or something label best eye drops i tend to wake up with dry goopy eyes and these mixed with the allergy drops completely fix the problem my eyes aren t dry and they don t itch i would much prefer to by these for dollars for the two of them then spend dollars on a copay for prescription ones that are only ounces i love that they are natural they don t burn or sting like some of the other otc eye drops i recommend them completely label works but expires days or something after opened if i known this expires a week after opening i would of not bought it it might be earlier then days not sure but i was pretty upset i wasted to put drops in once if they expire this short of a time make it little packets or something what a waste of a product i bought this thinking if it comes back i can use it again later and makes up for the high price also the box is also different what false advertising this product is so much lies and hidden info not mentioned label great a c for a small price iwas plesantly suprised how well the unit cools my large bedroom the de-humidefier cycle works great itmakes the air feel lite and fresh the thermostat works properly and the unit was relatively easy to install i can t imagine thatanother unit for twice the price would be any better label compressor works but no freon in system year warrany on sealed system where tried manufacture got hung up on then now told this is the old model the new one is like a aes3105 frigeration tech looked and turned on unit only saying it has a system leak or freon not installed so it will not get cold now maybe because it s a older model we can not get a replacement from seller maybe because it was a older model setting around and thus reason for problem in the first place now i had a guy install unit modify window to fit their unit and can not get warrantied as maker only changes smaller units out seller will not replace with current model aes3105 even though unit they sold me is defective and non-functional couple years old according to maker of units it will only blow warm air nothing close to cold with out freon maker said unit is a couple year older model and they will only exchange it a week process in the middle of coming summer in ok sucks label exactly what i needed for my class perfect condition used it for devry sociology class the class itself used the book and class readings the book met all of my needs label all talk no data a couple of good articles on primer testing but otherwise this book was almost devoid of any data it was just a few guys sitting around talking i regret buying it label excellent this is an excellent guide for the young horse owner our daughter just got her first horse and this guide will teach her much about caring for her horse label danger this book is a great book to read because it is adventurous this book is about a gril that gets her fortune told the fortune teller tells her that her brother is in trouble so she sets out to find her little brother on the way she has an adventure and some trouble if you want to read an adventurous book you should definitely pick this book label found it by chance opened my eyes to male sexuality i could not put this book down for a minute and i could not beleive that a male author could write so eloqently sexually and emotionally about his love for women the novel was very moving and i m looking for other books by butler with erotic themes label butler is a writer to watch the protagonist of this wonderful novel is by no means a misogynist he is a man who truly loves women and as we learn of his past loves we are blessed with a paen to the many ways men cherish women butler possesses a fantastic eye and they whisper is a kaleidoscope of love label delightful delicous easy i just bought this cookbook after a friend s recommendation a novel concept the book is divided into flip sections so you can open it up and bam you ve got a great dinner menu the instructions are so easy to follow and the author gives suggestions on which dishes to pair together i love it label painfully bad i regret to say that this was a boring disappointment not even anything about which to rant other than it s astounding suchaverage rehash makes it to a book label great sound great sound much better than the stock ipod earphones or buds knocked off one point because they are slightly too large the sound more than makes up for the slightly larger size considering the price and sound quality they are a steal label poor i bought these because my sony earbuds fontopoia with bass nipple i have had for years finally died these mx retail for here in aus and i can say that i was severely dissapointed in the sound quality for the price how much do i have to pay for a decent sound must be close to or more for these flimsy peices of plastic i am returning them as i expected more from a brand such as sennhheiser the sound was weak no presence in the highs or any bass all nasty mids these will be the last earbbud style headphones i ever bother with label this went nowhere after reading so much about the book in the nyt i was hoping it would pick up at some point however it didn t even at the end when you think it may it still falters sorry spend your time reading something else label i guess i m not qualified this is one of those books reading fans are supposed to like critics gave it glowing reviews and it was featured as a notable book of the year for the nytimes unfortunately i found it uninteresting and boring plus the main character misha flat out annoyed me and i was hoping for him to get blown up i must be missing something or not qualified to read this novel but to me it an excersise in trying to hard label belkin expresscard my ethernet port did not work any longer i use this computer for my business and cannot afford to be out of commission i received the belkin expresscard loaded the driver and was ready to go it has worked with no incident and at it saved me from purchasing a new computer it was a win-win all around for me i had ordered another expresscard through amazon but it was the wrong product amazon s return policy is great the return process was safe fast and extremely effective i will definitely continue using amazon as my first point of contact for future purchases and look at belkin for any future needs label belkin gigabit ethernet expresscard i just finished installing this gigabit ethernet adapter in an aging winxp dell laptop connected to our gigabit wired ethernet home network and the super easy install took less that five minutes the increase in speed over the previous intel ethernet network adapter was astonishing i measured mb s download speed from our local cox ip with our old dell laptop that is x the download speed with the adapter only negative i can see is that it appears not to have drivers for win label i like it purchased this for year-old band student works great in the texas heat no leakage comfortable to wear keeps water cool she gives it stars works as well as camelbak at lower price point label sultry noir music perfect background music for those of us who love film noir sexy sultry evocative musicians are wonderful and the audio quality is perfect so slip into something more comfortable and watch for your bogie or bacall to walk in the door label one of the coolest techno songs ever if you are looking for a cool techno trance song then this is definitely one of them i didn t care too much for the last two mixes but the rest especially the second track are great the first time i heard this song was in the movie formula during the club sequence i spent forever trying to find this song but finally found it here on amazon get this cd if not only to get a good song but to burn music from this disk to make your own trance collection which i did buy this you won t regret it also i recommend to anyone else who likes this music get the thrillseekers cd synathaesia it has the mix used in formula as well label classic warren miller could have done a better job remastering from vhs to dvd with that being said it s still classic warren miller and as the saying goes there ain t none better label case management review this was a required book for a case management class it was an easy read it is a good resource book for case managers and for people like me who had no prior knowledge of case management the language and explanations were easy to understand label great zombie flick this is a great movie for the zombie buff it s a serious movie and although i didn t like the end much i thought the ford brothers did an awesome job with it great quality production with the slower moving zombies like romero a must watch for the zombie fan label terrible the movie had a very basic storyline and ended on a note that didn t make sense at all africa is huge and the idea that every square inch of this country he is in is swarming with the undead is highly unlikely especially due to the fact that i can low crawl faster than these zombies walk parts of this movie are decent but the majority of it sucks if you want to watch a good zombie flick click next try something else label actually pretty good it is more focused on character than pure action but it has plenty of action nonetheless i was entertained and i hope they do a sequel label really really i know there are alot of zombie movies out there but really come on limited bullets so lets shot them zombies in the belly leg arm everywhere but the head the head is what you need to shot this movie is no walking dead lots of blood and eatting bodys but if you know a blow to the head is what kills them get it done big thumbs down label a grand conclusion for a classic epic yes i read others writing that they found it shallow or unrealistic unreasonable etc but for me i found it thrilling exciting and nail biting i switches back to jarad as a focal character and his bonding with an eagle which portends war along with another mage from a rival league civil war breaks out as an evil ghost takes over the power stone of the mages in the end a curse is broken that binds the dead mages to this realm i love the combination of technology and magecraft high tech verses an agrigarian society i see the writers soap box platform on saving our old growth forest i live in the pacific north west and have experienced it a lot and agree i look forward to his next book i find him a fascinating writer with thoughtful insight and three deminsional characters a real flare for style label eagle-sage as the third book in the series it was good but not as good as the prior two there was a certain tenseness missing that had been in the previous books it was good though to finish the story line and worth the price label worst ending ever this is by far one of the worst endings i have ever read the first book may have been good but coe failed to expand on any of the magic systems characters or subplots that had potential to make this book interesting the magic system was vague which is fine for a first novel but by the conclusion i want some explanation and unimaginative as were many of the characters the book s outcome was extaordinarily predictable if you have liked this series so far don t destroy your image with this book label the best money i ve spent on music in a while i was looking for a nice tmbg compilation to share with my sons ages and and came across this set and at a fabulous price on amazon and am pretty sure it was the best money i ve spent on music in a while great quality nice collection of tmbg classics and my boys have already memorized and are singing along to why does the sun shine i am a proud happy mother label d o a the acting lacked a lot in this movie and the plot lacked direction this is one of those films that could have at one point had potential but fell way short when actually done i normally enjoy lucy liu in films but not this time it just didn t make the grade and fell way short of my expectations label save your money this movie sucks this movie was a waste of time the only thing that made it watchable was lucy lui naked that s it and whats a vampire movie with no fangs label dangerdo not buy this product we bought this tea kettle to match our friendly village dish pattern we especially wanted a whistling tea kettle well it did not whistle we filled it with water and went about our household business we were sitting in the next room when we smelled something burning we rush back to the kitchen the water had evaporated the kettle never whistled its bottom melted and it ruined the stove heating coil and drip collar do not buy this product label i love it this is a realy great album by merle haggard for the fans of merle this album is a must have label the hag is back best vocals i have heard merle record since the mid-eighties i thought due to age and other elements that his voice was headed down-hill i don t know whether his vocals have improved or if he has just learned to sing slightly different to match the change in pitch in my opinion this album as a whole contains his best music in twenty years none of the songs stand-out above the rest but they are all solid his past studio albums contain great songs surrounded by very bland ones recent albums may have had good lyrics but the music doesn t stand up to the standards merle has set in the past chicago wind is an surprisingly wonderful exception to this it is a shame that most c w radio stations will never play any songs that make their listeners think about political social economic or environmental issues label getting over the clouds william kershner is a technical author with a flair for humor that is reminiscent of samuel clements his writings are clear instructional and pure reading enjoyment bill s latest work logging flight time is a core book for the libraries of true pilots everywhere it also is a must for non-fliers who might like insight into those individuals who lived during an era when aviators were heroes kershner s crisp collection of events from his career will appeal to all who have any fascination for the sheer fun and wonder of flight label i d be humiliated if i was the pilot in this book the author gives a bad name to professional pilots the antics of the characters in this book would only appeal to young guys who like to party and drink everyone has to start somewhere so maybe the author will improve as he goes along label perhaps the lowest quality cd ever released could not wait for this cd to arrive at my office being a huge duke fan popped it in my car cd player on the way home from work i assumed my cd player or speakers had experienced a total melt-down the sounds on all tracks were so thin and tinny they sounded like a telephone call so i checked this cd on two more players surprise it wasn t the hardware it was the cd i own thousands of cds and have never ever heard a recording this poorly engineered and presented that sent me back to listen to the amazon samples this cd has exactly that same horrible level of recording as the samples do not buy this cd under any circumstances it is totally useless unless you are searching for a new drink coaster label final cut live rocks this cd is worth buying for the final cut live the live version of the song final cut is an expirence not given in many of coheed s other songs the live version gives you an extened song with more and better solos label don t be fooled don t be fooled by the well known actors and the academy award nomination this one is really really bad the camera music and story just float all over the place unless you like these surreal type of movies you will be fast asleep within minutes in all fairness i think this is another movie that some will get and others will not get seven psychopaths is a similar type of movie maybe this type of movie is for you but i have no patience for this slow moving type of story label open your mind joaquin phoenix is the main reason i watched this movie it s his first serious acting role since his whole rap documentary hoax i m still here i thought i m still here was pretty ballsy and no regrets because joaquin blew me away people don t realize his acting depth honestly you have to go into this movie with an open mind and free time because it s slower paced philip seymour hoffman s acting was really phenomenal and passionate as well this movie is definitely an acquired taste go into this movie with the acting in mind not so much the plot or the cinematography or visuals label prepare to be bored out of your mind we rented this movie because of the academy award nominations for joaquin he did do great job in that aspect but otherwise the movie is very boring label joaquin phoenix is great the film is terrible director paul thomas anderson once again proves that he is incapable of telling a compelling story anderson is great with a camera and phoenix is seething in his portrayal of an alcoholic wanderer but there is no story here the second half of the film is just a boring wasteland of wandering awful film label one star is generous zero stars i felt compelled to write a review to save people from wasting their time and money on this garbage i had the misfortune of seeing this movie today with my husband and we both couldn t believe what a horribly written and misogynistic movie this was literally people were walking out left and right the movie attempts to create an engaging storyline that leaves the viewer disgruntled and confused the ending was flat like the storyline and at the end of the movie my husband said well that was a waste of two hours and the couple behind us said we were just saying the same thing save yourself the time and frustration and skip this one label fyi this dvd is not very good at all i love to dance so i picked up this video thinking it would be a fun way to work out boy was i wrong its very boring it takes them forever to teach you the moves then you go through it fast paced a few times and you are on to the next one i used it once got halfway through and shut it off i dont know why they would ever describe this as a workout if i were you i would shell out the extra bucks and get a better fitness dvd label boring i am not really athletic person and i am not in a great shape recently after pregnancy i haven t worked out for quite a bit and this work out barely made me sweat plus it was quite boring and very repetitive for person like me any better work out probably would cause some sore muscles etc but this did not if you want fun and little more sweat i would suggest carmen electra s striptease workout i used disc no it was really much easier to repeat and i sweat a lot more and got a little of sore muscles in my legs next day and carmen has much better and warmer personality than robin from pcd label fun a very fun work out it is so much fun you dont realize you are working out i use this dvd every day label pcd makes you dance i was skeptical about what this dvd actually had to offer however now that i have it i couldn t be more happy with my purchase this dvd teaches you how to loosen up and be cute and playful or a little playfully sexy the dance choreography is easy to learn and a lot of fun it s not like some of those other workout dvd s that have you moving in awkward moves that you wouldn t be caught dead doing in front of a mirror much less at a club you definitely get cardio time and a ton of cute moves from clips of dontcha buttons and a super cute burlesque piece label pounds lost in weeks i have read some of the reviews and noticed that some people said it is too slow let me tell you this workout is fast paced unless you re just standing there and berly moving i can see how you wont break a sweat but by the end of the workout my clothes is dripping with sweat i did this workout for weeks exactly mo fri and i lost pounds and im still going to keep doing it you have to really move like the girls in the video to get results these girls that don t like the video must not now how to move at all label love it love the sexy moves great to get your heart pumping and it s empowering i m a plus size girl and i enjoy it label spider-man peel stick wall border product delivered fast and it was easy to peel and stick on the wall great product for price no problems with it adhering to the wall and my son loves his spiderman room label looks really nice if you can get it to stay in place i was very excited to put this border up in my son s room it took me about hours to get it perfect we went out for a couple of hours and when i returned home i went in to the room to check out my handy work it was all on the floor i have had other peel and stick and have stayed on perhaps i just got bad rolls or this product just doesn t stick i was very dissappointed i gave it one star on appearance now i m nervous about purchasing another peel and stick product label eye pillow doggie gifted this to a dog lover friend and she loved it only downside was that i m not sure i had the option to gift this purchase so perhaps my giftee found out how much her christmas gift cost this year label tres de cafe y dos de azucar this cd is one of three recordings that the duo of pacheco and el conde made in thier early years while together it s great like their other albums the combo do an outstanding job musically this masterpiece was first released in but the swing is still there and will have you dancing to its beat highly recommend for that swinger in you label a bunch of overated sacriligious garbage south park is a show that everyone seems to love i love family guy with its adult humor but i seriously found no humor in south park i tried to get into it but all the jokes were lame stupid and the characters were annoying with their weird shapes and annoying voices on top of it the humor in this show is way over the top and seriously sacriligious jesus in a boxing match against the devil getting his but kicked come on the passion of the jew this is trash and i m ashamed that our country enjoys it so you know what give me out of helpful votes because all of you love it but at least i spoke my thoughts on this awful show label dissapointed the tree arrived with a broken base and in really bad shape have picture to proof it the bonsai was trimmed to early so during the trip lost its natural beauty it was a present for a friend and she was obliged to return it due to its bad quality label a straightforward specialized genealogy reference world war ii military records a family historian s guide is a straightforward specialized genealogy reference and instructional guide to finding and interpreting key information from military personnel records casualty reports ww ii draft registrations burial sites awards and medals and more an excellent tool for anyone interested in genealogy or military research world war ii military records is an important addition to both genealogy and military studies reference collections label incomplete patterns there were no top views of any of the many bird patterns in this book all the fish patterns had top views i was disappointed and tried to call al he provided a phone number in the back of the book and that number was disconnected if it had top views of the birds like it did for the fish i would have given it or stars i carved the catfish and was pleased with how the book walked through that project i have not carved any of the birds though and that is why i bought this book label disappointed in this one didn t like this book as well as the little soul and the sun as we had a home birth and this book is all about a baby born into the hospital also the book ends abruptly kind of odd like there should be another chapter atleast label very informative and interesting great read for an anthropology class of the late s the west and the rest are examined well in terms of race and gender label advance wall clock i like it seems well made i use it in my shop which gets very cold in the winter and too warm in the summer so far no problems with it label the music is beyond repair with one or two isolated exceptions these compositions are astonishingly boring if you purchase the recording anyway be warned that out of tracks are likely to disappoint label good chow this is one of the best dog food s i have gotten yet my dog likes it and it is good for him my vet said it is good brand also cost a little more but if i eat the best why shouldn t my dog label incredible fabrications of history does she know anything about japan s wartime history just google unit the place where her own daddy probably worked at is it a pure coincidence that her daddy lived in the area where these despicable inhuman experiments took place label a reader from harare zimbabwe march i really injoyed this book i just read it for class book reading i found some parts in the book that were very sad but not sad enough for tears this book was one of the books that i cant put down once i was into the chapter i couldn t stop reading the book i will never forget that i read this book as a young kid label this book is compelling realistic and unforgettable this book is compelling a page-turner realistic and unforgettable label a learning experience this was a very good book when i found out later that this book was recommended for children and young adults to read i was very surprised i m not sure if a child would be able to take the emotional heartbreak of this story but as for adults it was very informative and touching i cried when reading some parts and knowing that when you are living it you cannot just stop living it you must go on the writing is exceptional not sentimental or romanticized like some books i looked at the world in a new way after reading this i don t think my struggles can ever be as bad and if they are i know i can handle them if the girl in this story could label costly piece of junk my daughter got this from her grandparents for a birthday present i am not a seamstress but i know how to set up a sewing machine properly my daughter spent hours trying to figure this thing out i managed to get everything set up except for the bobbin area i managed to snap the thread times and still have not been able to thread it effectively this really isn t the best machine to be learning on go to a thrift store and purchase one from there instead or try your local freecycle i think her grandparents paid cdn total waste-o-money we cant even send it back because we mangled the box trying to get to the machine i give this out of stars don t waste your money on this mess label hawaiian umbrella tree this item was very dissappointing i returned this item and still no one will credit my account the tree was broke and dead when this arrived label muppet show music mayhem and crap misrepresented the sales pitch makes it seem like a dvd with maybe a few episodes or muppet music videos but no its a crappy music cd with lame songs that are no fun to listen to without watching them performed i was way disapointed label class text bought this book for a class world economics history and theory it is a heavy read and contains good information label the wealth and poverty of nations by landes it was one of the most entertaining books i ve ever read the insight and attempt at explaining the causes of wealth creation met with my limited understanding of the issue much more so than jared diamond s geographical emphasis i keep buying copies as a gift for people with a genuine interst in the topic and have not met with any disappointments label a pathetic conclusion to a once-great series the first two games in the monkey island series were fresh funny and inventive the curse of monkey island is none of these things rather it feels like a harsh and manufactured attempt to recreate what made the first two games so great it does not succeed without ron gilbert and without the slightest idea of what the first two games were about the curse of monkey island had it been called something else as it should have might have been okay but its poor graphics mostly unfunny humor and theme completely foreign to the series make it a game no fun of the series should bother to play if you ve never heard of monkey island before it may be worth it but it s not likely label does not support ups to power it if you buy this don t expect to power it with a ups i hooked mine up with a apc ups with an attached additional battery pack for extended life when i had the first power outage all went fine until the power came back on and it the ups switched to utility power from battery back up and the monster went through a full reset causing all of the connected devices to have to be reprogrammed monster said that they did not support their device on a ups so i have a monster hts for a door stop absolutely worthless to me label best purchas in a long time i recently purchased a new denon receiver for my home theater to replace a marantz that did not do hdmi switching when i hooked up my samsung blu-ray and toshiba hd-dvd player the picture looked good but when i connected my ps3 red lines appeared on my tv i tried different hdmi cables including monster cables that were over one hundred dollars but still saw red lines my last resort was change from a cheap surge protector to this power center after purchasing monster reference center the red lines disappeared and all video signals looked much better sound quality also improved i am going to buy another one for my bedroom setup label excellent product i was a bit leery after reading some of the reviews about this product but i can say that it has made a profound improvement in the sound and the picture quality of my home theater system no longer do i hear the occasional popping sounds on the audio of most of our hdtv stations the video has much less horizontal streaking my experience with my wife listening was similar to other reviewers she confirmed my observations spontaneously i suppose that the degree of improvement must vary with the amount of signal noise that is present in the buyer s home area label china mfg meter i must say i was not impressed with the overall quality of the units at all the internal electronics looked to be of very poor assembly and quality i had recently purchased two similar units which i returned due to the fact they did not operate properly i have learned my lesson no more cheap products from china when possible label good adaptation of a superb novel the national treedavid kranes outstanding novel the national tree finds a solid adaptation in this hallmark production the essence of the book a deep and evocative exploration of a father and son relationship is beautifully captured in the film the premise a cross country trip to deliver the national tree to the president s lawn is well rendered andrew mccarthy and andrew williams do a superb job but in an hour and a half the quirkiness and delight of the novel could not be completely explored kranes characteristic gentle and offbeat humor comes through so much more completely in the book which has become a family christmas classic for so many people label tired rehash of father-son bonding scenario i m sorry but there was just nothing original or noteworthy about this film about a father and son who learn to bond while taking their family s tree to be planted in washington dc along the way the boy meets up with his online girl friend who decides to tag along without dad knowing and gruff dad starts having feelings for the go-getter pr woman and vice-versa traveling behind them arranging for media attention the plot was predictable from the get-go and the acting was uninspired about as wooden as the tree they are carrying in the back of the big rig mediocre hallmark viewing here certainly not worth buying the dvd in my humble opinion label national tree patriotism feel good story about the national christmas tree also the story of a man accepting the maturity of his son and watching what he has taught him prevail when the time was right great xmas movie men and ladies one of my favorites label improvise by mick napier a decent book that gives different types of ideologies for improvisation the book is pretty much opinion but i still enjoyed the author s insightful observations and solutions to repetitive improv habits worth the money label get it and get it right why can t anyone list this wonderful little hd tv correctly i purchased one at wally world and it works great the sound is very good too it has the normal hd tv inputs plus the atsc tuner and it even has vga input so i can connect it to my notebook pc and watch my mlb com baseball games on a better screen this is a true hd tv the resolution is an not the as shown in amazon com buy this for your bedroom or any small room application it s great label dead tla-c tla-c dead i bought this tv used from a friend but with the manufacture date of i never figured a name brand tv would just die after a few years after reading other comments i noticed all the warning signs the screen would freeze while watching digital cable after the freezes become more frequent startups started to take longer during the slow startups the screen would seem fuzzy with bands of the picture being out of whack it would take longer and longer for the tv to be clear after startup then the screen became white the tv would no longer work it would just be a white screen with lines in it so do not buy it will break and it will break soon i seem to be one of the lucky ones as others broke within the warranty period and had to deal with horrible tech support label dr mercola s total health program the proven plan to prevent disease and premature aging optimize weight and live longer i have not finished reading the book but what i have read so far is very interesting label wonderful health book i borrowed this book from a neighbor and loved it so had to own it i am looking forward to finding out my metabolic type as well it s good to see that he doesn t advocate every supplement on the planet thereby breaking you but uses a few crucial ones hopefully this book will help my change my food lifestyle and add years to my life label star because there is no choice for less this book is a waste of time and money it is a gathering of other s work that he has obviously copied without proper references a small article could encompass the whole book also i found his recipes so unpractical and without a proper study as they do not show any nutritious data about them the recipes are an advertisement for mercola s store this book tries to lure people into buying mercola s products i consider it a rip-off rather that a helpful book i like dr weil better as he is more earthbound and practical label best of show nutritionally dr mercola has worked long and hard to get the word out that it matters what you eat yes it does matter what you eat want to live a long healthy life eat according to the program laid out in this book want to avoid cancer heart disease and diabetes eat according to the program laid out in this book as a health author nutritional consultant and colon hydrotherapist there are few other mentors who have taught me more than dr joseph mercola kristina amelong cnc ctwww optimalhealthnetwork com label great beginning but lost some of the magic as the story developed the first couple of chapters of this book had me completely mesmorized the instant attraction to one another the fae mysteries working their magic and a soul that badly needed to be healed it had the makings of a book that one would read and re-read until the pages fell from the book from overuse but all too quickly it went downhill deborah macgillivray was on the right track early on but it became boring and repetative all too quickly i plan to read more of her books she started out captivating the reader but that captivation turned into repetition there is only so much excitement that one can draw from an apple tree no matter how ancient and powerful it may be label i really tried i tried i really really tried to read this book i forced myself to read more than half of it but then i had to give up the plot was boring and i felt like i have read it a billion other times in a billion other boring books the dialogue was awful the characters were flat label too difficult for lower-level spanish readers i am in a spanish class in college yet i found this book still too difficult to read i also expected it not to be as longi was looking for a book that was only around pages label fantastic book most books assume that the reader has a month to carefully read the book in reality the reader often has a day or two and needs a solid understanding of the material but not a really detailed understanding this book is great because it quickly and clearly covers all of the necessary concepts what else can you ask for label how do you use this to teach spanish i borrowed this set from the library after reading through the introduction and then listening to a couple of the tracks on the cd i have no idea how you re supposed to use this to teach spanish if there was a picture for each phrase then maybe i could understand but there s not between high school and college i took five years of spanish so my non-understanding is not from not knowing any spanish i m going to keep looking label did not like it at all i thought this was going to have lots of songs and it did not it only has a few songs and the rest is people reading off the book very boring label not yet received the item i have not received this item yet its been over a month since i placed the order is it not available label too complex not good as a primary text for teaching spanish at home songs are very complicated with lots of difficult vocabulary while children may learn to sing a song they certainly are not going to know what it means i am going to be looking for something else to use very disappointed since some of the other reviewers suggested this would be a good tool to use at home label surprisingly disappointing first i just want to say that i love diana palmer she is fabulous and fun one of my favorites this book was not diana palmer material it is about a young girl who falls in love with an older man and waits a year for him until he over comes his wife s death in the meantime brianne s horrible step father promises her hand in marriage to someone else and brianne will do everything she can to keep from marrying this evil man with the help of peirce if he gets over his wife s death i could hardly stand pierce for he was boring self centered and childish and though brianne was not as naive as one would think she was still not a very bright young woman i found the plot somewhat weak even though ms palmer snuck in a few surprises with the oil companies and wars and etc i found tate winthrop more exciting than anyone in this book and he was hardly in it i know the next book i read by her will be much better i am not giving up on her label i feel gross scratches seemed like an interesting game a little frustrating definitely creepy but i ll never know how it ends i stopped playing it and never intend to again i got to the point in the game where you are expected to put a nail in the feet of a statue of christ to open a secret door and couldn t believe this was actually a part of a game i m not the most devout person in the world but that just felt utterly wrong i don t care about the spoiler alert i wish someone had done the same for me before i wasted time and money label no puedes pedir mas por el precio este libro te ayuda a entender la gramatica del lenguaje ingles y te ayuda a poder hablarlo y escribirlo mejor is one of the best tools anyone can have when learning to speak or better english skills label gramatica de la lengua inglesa i find this book quite difficult for the spanish-speaking adult student who i am working with any spanish-speaking person would need a high level of education in his own language to comprehend the explanations and directions my student is perhaps educated through grade school this would be a good book for someone who is advanced in the spanish language there are lines for answers but they are close together perhaps college-ruled or closer so the handwriting would have to be fairly small a good point about this book is that the answers are in the back there are pages of workbook pages then there are two appendices and the answers and one page of an index total pages label the priests dvd i can t believe i did not know about this dvd earlier after it was made i love sacred music and there are many beautiful inspiring music for the soul i love concertizing beautiful sacred music which lifts and nourishes the soul whether one attends a church or not the music speaks for itself we need more of this type of concerts the priests are great i hope they continue to create more dvds such as this music is another way communicating with god and the joy of the music certainly uplifts every soul who supports good music label messenger bag this bag has been very handy for me not only with class supplies but also for everyday things instead of carrying a purse as well i just carry this one bag i ve been able to use it for digital photography class to carry supplies and class instructions and it s very comfortable to walk around san francisco in label great ideas many delicious ice cream recipes in this book along with other recipes for desserts drinks and more really helps to understand the basics of making homemade ice cream most recipes will make a generous quart which ends up being approx quarts prompt shipment and great product label the only ice cream recipe book you ll ever need incredible recipes that are impossible to goof really challenges quality store bought ice cream label delicious and fantastic buy the recipes in here are true to the ben jerry s products you find on the frozen section of your grocery store i easily achieved amazing results with the recipes they provided try the peanut butter fudge ribbon variation you will not believe it this book is very pratical and written with great humour i strongly recommend this book to the novice with a sense of adventure as well as for the more experienced ice cream epicurian sincerely blanche montreal qc label great buy great little book to start ice cream making with the intro is mostly biography there is a section to better understand ice cream making key ingredients why you need to use whole milk as opposed to fat free etc and the rest of the book is recipes they have great techniques but they are often in sidebars rather than being on a separate page or chapter as far as the recipes go it is great they have different ice cream bases and suggest in each recipe which base works best for flavor they also have recipes for sorbets toppings fudge caramel etc and other desserts that can be used as add ins brownies blondies etc it also obviously doesn t talk about frozen yogurt my only problem is that it isn t quite as organized as i would like to get to a specific technique like adding a fudge swirl to an ice cream great buy label ok review of ice cream cookbook after reading all the reviews of this ben and jerry s ice cream recipe book i ordered it i do not think it contains what i was looking forward to with the recipes contained therein and would not order it again knowing its contents i found that surfing the internet gave me the recipes i wanted for example pistachio ice cream peanut butter cup ice cream etc label pyramid rpr425 gauge power wire my grandson used this wire to connect his speaker system up in his new car i can assure you that the wiring works i hear that radio thumping all the time thus far he hasn t had any problems i e wire burning or melting label not real gauge this wire is not true gauge i would not recomend this for anything other than speaker wire label not what i was looking for i was looking more for crossword puzzles there are very few of those in here it s fine if you re looking for other kinds of puzzles label funny witty and full of surprises i enjoy good movies so i found this book to be the perfect summer read it s funny and witty and full of surprises about nick and his hollywood associates i had no idea the actor was so dedicated and so much fun to be around label some important product details playboy s playmate of the monthraquel gibson photographed by stephen wayda and arny freytaginterviewjamie foxx by michael flemingfeaturesafter the party with jamie foxx a brash playboy interviewin bed with the girls next door e s hot new showspecial photo feature dancing with the stars kelly monacoplus winter coats harvey pekar an nfl tragedymodelbridget marquardt holly madison and kendra wilkinson covergirl nude inside photographed by arny freytag label not received yet i ve not received it and its taking long time than expected since i ve not received it i can t say whether its good or not label auto shut off does not work the iron automatically shut off four times while i was ironing one shirt the instructions say that the iron shuts off after seven minutes but it s more like every thirty seconds very annoying the iron does not produce much steam also the headlight is very difficult to turn off an off and on label poor having used mavis beacon long ago i wanted a refresher this program is really not well designedthe biggest problem is each exercise only features a line or two of the appropriate new symbols keys and then you are typing all the letters you knowsometimes even ones you haven t been taught yetso it s difficult to solidify the finger positioning of new keys and gets confusing really not well thought out there are enough advanced features that an experienced typist can increase their speed or a child could learn on it but mb is so much better someone claiming to go from to wpm in a week is either an experienced typist that was rusty or lying then wpm sure label company does not stand behind product this is the second rip off product that i have owned and this one must be a dud i would expect someone to help me but i get no help beware label a waste of time and money if you are considering purchasing this thing to make copies of commercially made vhs tapes to dvd don t waste your time or your money because it is essentially useless for that purpose the resulting copies are horrible grainy and with jittery lines in the picture etc some people say this thing will remove the macrovision protection which is responsible for the wavy lines and such but forget it it will not at least not to any kind of acceptable degree as far as i know it is legal to make a backup copy of original tapes that you own for your own personal use under the fair use provision just as you can make an archival copy of computer software as long as it is for your own use and not to sell etc the only reason i gave this thing stars is that it might prove useful for transferring home videos to dvd although i have not tried that yet label beautiful this is slow beautiful music not ambient and not new age and not sappy in my opinion just simply beautiful think mogwai lanterna or dif juz but better there are low volume vocals but mostly instrumental some of the most perfect peaceful music the song the sort of juice i m used to is by far the best don t let the interesting song titles fool you this is a must have label since otar left this touching film speaks to the irrational ties of familial loyalty that even a lifetime of hurt won t extinguish with warmth and subtlety it details how the younger generation of women protect the health and well-being of the eldest through the kindest of deceptions though consumed by long-simmering resentment over eka s favoritism toward her only son marina still makes an unselfish choice to shield eka from hurt otar is a life-affirming gem with all three actresses superb in the central roles particularly gorintin who broke my heart as eka label polyethnic slamgrass salmon s best effort to date guest appearances by waylon jennings taj mahal bela fleck and j b make this a very entertaining and memorable album jg label good thoughts but poorly written this book has many good thoughts and insights but is poorly written a good editor would have helped this author immensely it has bad syntax and sentence structure and was a frustrating and laborious read i hope and pray that mr rogers publishes another volume of this he has wonderful insight which unfortunately becomes diminished by the lack of time that was spent on editing label mexican house building how-to in story format sort of this is a great story of how an american couple built their mexican dream house in sayulita mexico near puerto vallarta while it s not a mexican house building how-to it does give you an idea of what you ll have to go through to build an authentic mexican house on your own hopefully you ll have a good experience as this couple did and not like the one described ingod and mr gomez label they re back ye gads i m and first read this book in the th grade ever since my boys were born they are now and i ve been searching bookstores for the three investigators and always told they were out of print finally my kids have the chance to read something exciting that demonstrates the power of logic and critical examination to solve a problem everything winds up having a logical real-world explanation none of this x-file mystery junk that has no bearing on reality and done by characters that are believable and all children can relate to i re-read this book numerous times in my childhood and hope my children will enjoy it as much as i did long live jupe pete and bob and tunnel two label not the right ink to go with the printer i purchased i purchased an epson stylus phot printer and this ink was featured on the same page to buy together however this is not the correct ink for the printer and should not have been featured to buy together it s most likely good ink it s just not compatible with the epson stylus label it s an ink cartridge i installed this cartridge in my printer as soon as it arrived since i was completely out of black ink then i ran a couple of test prints to check the alignment and nozzles and all was perfect so what can i say it s an ink cartridge and it works as well as expected label doubtful it is a new epson cartridge i read a lot of reviews and a lot of them said only buy your ink from epson i couldn t resist the price and bought off amazon this black cartridge took about minutes of convincing reinstalling head cleaning repeat etc before it would print black i also bought a pack of colors because the package looked authentic duh they weren t in a package when they arrived they were made in mexico they may be former epson cartridges that have been refilled i haven t tried them yet as a consolation prize they sent me a black cartridge along with my colors lesson learned after this i will only buy ink for epson printers from epson label it works the first time around i have heard a lot of people say how the printer did not recognize the ink cartridges and i was a little worried however i had no problem with the printer or the cartridges it worked fine and i am very pleased with the printer and the cartridges label yeah i have to agree this book is so terribly written and edited that it was impossible to begin to tackle flash mx with it i don t know why i didn t check amazon first by the first chapter i knew this book was going to be useless three pages into chapter one she begins a segment called get a flash file up on the web now why would you concern yourself with this step in the beginning of the first chapter of a book on how to use flash that s the way the whole book goes a disaster label only oatmeal no granola this product is only sweetened oatmeal with varying amounts of blueberries but there is absolutely no granola in any of the the boxes i ve eaten so far so when the box says granola read oatmeal and six dried blueberries it tastes fine for what it is just know that it is not granola like the box says it is label if you are a true bt fan you ll love this what more can i really say what s nice about this one is that its all john not that the rest of bt pulls him down or anything its just nice to see a different side of john the music resembles blues traveler but it is not the same so don t expect that if you re buying this cd this peaceful sound is a must have for your collection label really good when i bought this video i was not sure if would be affordable but when i watched i really enjoy it good music good harmony good jokes i love gvb and i like signature sound but when i watched together it was if gaither joined the best of gvb with the best of ss surely recommended label wonderful magic combination this is a wonderful dvd put out by bill gaither featuring the gaither vocal band and ernie haase and signature sound they are magical together there is a unique blend of all their voices that is so great the choice of songs on this dvd was spectacular but i think the greatest one if i had to pick just one was sitting at the feet of jesus i have many of the bill gaither vhs tapes and dvd s and although i don t have some of the older ones i have not heard this particular song sung on any of them before it has always been one of my very favorites but this pairing of the two groups was nothing but inspirational on bill s part to do this label totally dissatisfied the speaker is very bad the music not good the actual routine goes too fast how do they expect begginers to follow this routine label if your friends don t get it they re not worthy of you my parents used to play this at their cocktail parties to see who was paying attention if attendees didn t catch the whimsy they were deemed dense if they sang along in the same cadence and or pitch they were deemed drunk enough and were served no more but applauded for their efforts this is actually a product of two very talented people who probably had a struggle with singing and playing terribly i have been looking for lps of this for yrs at flea markets garage sales etc it is here at amazon that i found it i am extremely gratified it has helped me separate the chaff from the wheat in the friend department label the voice of an angel it is wonderful to hear angelic music like this nobody can do a song like darlene edwards her husband jonathan is equally talented on the piano my favorite time to listen to this is either after a stressful time at work any time i want to relax darlene has the voice of an angel what kind of angel you decide label the shooter the perfomance by randy travis and michael dutikoff were very understated they both did a great job i was able to work on this movie and randy travis actually shoots me the opening scene is the only thing that makes this an r rated movie otherwise it is great if you are going to watch it with the kids start it after the whipping scene or have it cued up so they don t have to see it label wiggles fan our daughter is a big wiggles fan and really enjoys watching this whether at home or in our vehicle we find ourselves singing and dancing to the tunes also it does have a few songs in spanish worth the purchase if your child is a fan label handy to keep in the car the factory charger cord finally crapped out and this one fits the cigarette lighter snugly without slipping out it does what it s supposed to label somewhat tiresome the book started out interesting but about half way through it got tiresome the villians were predictable and the plot far to slow at pages from the end just didn t care anymore those last few pages were really hard to get through yet should have been the best part of the book sorry just can t recommend this one label how musical performances interact with local social systems gregory barz s music in east africa introduces readers to the historical and modern musical performances unique to east africa chapters in his music in east africa select individual musicians working in both traditional and contemporary fusions of sounds add eyewitness accounts of performances and descriptions of how musical performances interact with local social systems and you have a blend of music theory and anthropology unique to this series label barely functional anymore years ago these used to be good now it s hard to find one that works properly you have to get a box of and hope some of them will work well why is this it s become a throw-away society quality is on the decline speedball probably thinks that few will notice the reduction in quality except for the handful of professionals who are experts on their materials so why not cut some corners and make more profits i ve been using drawing inking art supplies for years professionally and i have a hard time getting these to do their job now many of my other pro friends say the same thing i ve switched to deleter s comic pen from japan and it works as it should label highly disappointed fist of all i didn t receive the flea zapper shown in the picture even though that is the one i ordered i sent a e-mail to the company but got no reply the nd problem is the fact that it doesn t work it does not zap the fleas as stated the teeth on the comb are too close together so the cats hair doesn t go through them i ran it over fleas on the cat s belly where there is very little hair same results nothing happened i am very disappointed with this product and want my money back label different battles is a fascinating read different battles is a truly unusual book it s a meticulously researched vividly imagined historical study but it s also a moving personal memoirall the more powerful for being understated on top of all that it s a fascinating read the author grew up in vero beach florida during world war ii when german subs were a greater threat along the u s east coast than most people realized the boy s father kit johnson uses his fishing boat to search for and rescue the survivors of ships torpedoed by the germans he later fights a very different battle with alzheimer s peter cremer the charismatic and somewhat enigmatic commander of a german u-boat captures the reader s imagination but as we gradually come to realize the author s father is the real hero of the book label diary of st faustina st faustina s diary is absolutely beautiful as i have been reading i have fallen in love with st faustina and feel a very strong connection with her even as she suffered and struggled she always stayed focused on christ and lived her life beautifully for him i encourage you to read this book and just enjoy the beauty of how much god loves us label simply divine this book provides an excellent insight into a humble soul truly united with christ it s an inspiration to re-examine our own lives to see the how we can unite our sufferings with the lord and allow christ to work through us it also reinforces the message of god s divine mercy and god s desire to shower us with his mercy when many may think we do not derserve it or even want it while we can never merit god s mercy he truly was working through st faustina to spread his message that he wants to give his mercy to all who accept him and to the whole world which is in so desperate need of mercy reading this book will make you look at things differently and it is a grace to read label comercial this magazine has been most of time full of not well written article too much advertise inside and very repetitive it needs more creativity and embracement of ahimsa towards the reders i mean i can read an article without being attacked by on the hundreds of commercials inside which becomes very distractive i think it should be free at every yoga studio entrance or a very small fee to be delivered at your house label will review it if it ever arrives ordered it and paid for it in full two-year subscription on january as a gift for my wife it is almost june and it s no deal from deal universe label to much on religion i gave this a a gift to a chick friend of mine and she said this mag takes yoga to much as a religion than a workout i told her well yeah thats what it is what did you expect label too female-oriented y j used to be more geared to everyone now it has a guy s picture on the cover only once in years label war with grandpa i like this book because it is funny it s about a boy who had to give up his room for his grandpa they started a war grandpa had problems with his leg but he succeded on the war peter has a little sister named jenny and a mom and dad whenever peter does something to his grandpa he gets back and one time grandpa took peter fishing if you want to know more read it label an awsome book war with grandpa is an awsome book it is about peter stocks and his grandpa go to war when grandpa take his room you would like it if you like funny books my favirot partis when granpa did his last move label the war with grandpa i rate this book because i think that the author shouldn t have made the ending the way it ended the book is about a boy named peter he loves his room when he hears the news that his grandpa is coming he is happy but when he looks into it he finds out that grandpa is taking his room he starts a war i would recommend this book if you do not like your grandpa it might give you some ideas age-wise i would say this is for kids ages years old it s a comedy n64 nds label grandpa s war i liked this book because it has a war wars are not good but in this book they learn their lesson by passing notes to each other they ended the war i would recommend this book review by koresha label warwith grandpa i think the storey was grat because peter chris to get his room back and dose he secseed find out if you read this grat book label warwithgrandpa i dont like this book very much becaus it dident have enoughexcitment and the words are easy to read one part of the storyi liked was when they caught a whole bunch of flounder label the war with grandpa i think this was a great book my favorite part is when peter stole grandpa s false teeth my least favorite part is when grandpa pull s all those dirty tricks on peter all together i think you will like this book label tuck triumphant when helen s family decides to adopt a child they get a korean boy named chok do choy when they pick him up at the airport they find out a horrible secret read the book to find out the book is well written and the author makes you want to read on theodore taylor is a very colorful writer he uses lots of literary devices and he makes me feel like i m right in the story i would recommend this book to people who like suspense tragedy and humor label prefer his spanish music i love marc anthony love his voice love his songs but not crazy about this cd i just don t like his english music so much i knew two of the songs on this cd and didn t mind listening to them but wasn t crazy enough to love all the songs or the cd it s just not me i think marc anthony is better and more emotional in spanish than in english label ay bendito ay bendito que te paso mi jo el mejor de los artistas con esas cosas you know better you all know what i mean y no es porque no me guste la salsa en ingles recordemos a tito nieves enough label reviews can we talk he got you yes marc anthony he sure got me touch me touch me this man is like the best yes most definitely have you ever had your soul touched he can do that oh my goodness my baby you you will love this song my baby you are the reason i can fly yes he will take you to the depths of your soul and then lift you to the stars saw him on michael jackson s th singing she s out of my life and i m sure the whole world went to buy his cd the very next day i truly feel all the songs on this cd you will die for you can feel his passion like wow you just gotta get this cd words just cannot explain how great this man is we need his kind of music to stimulate the senses and feel the passion and we all love passion and very romantic all ages would love this cd sincerely princesscolleen xxo label good singer bad songs i love love love love marc anthony he is one of my favorite latino singers and i have followed him from the beginning of his career if you want his best work buy his spanish albums amazon has all of them kudos he somehow loses the passion and energy on this album if you like latin-influenced pop music watered down for an american audience that is too narrow minded to listen to lyrics in other languages then you will like this album and the other latin craze music martin iglesias lopez latin music has been around forever it is a shame that americans think it is now the rage because a few english albums with latin beats have been released in other countries the music scene is much more international label el cd mas bueno de marc anthony este cd de marc anthony es el mas bueno ke a sakado tiene todo salsa pop y romantica las canciones estan super buenisimas y tienen mucho sentimiento se lo recomiendo a todos los ke le guste la muica romantica label you can sing i m sorry move over ricky martin and enrique marc has real talent he can actually sing that s something rare in music today he tore up my baby you no me ames and i want to spend my lifetime loving you go marc you have skills boyee label riding the waves marc anthony has hopped on a shiny pop music train with his self-titled english debut while longtime fans wont find much of the salsa here that they ve always known him for there s still plenty of continuity in the fact that he s as fine a singer as ever and a sure romantic then again marc anthony has always been about putting his own spin on his roots so would-be critics should be warnedhe wont be tied down the single i need to know with its pulsing salsa horns and piano was a ubiquitous item on mainstream radio that clearly rode the fast waters of the latin floodgate opened by ricky martin anthony used to sing back up to menudo and others thats okay delves a bit deeper into the clave while the plaintive how could i combines the fluid fire of spanish guitar with soft slow-jam programming a sweet pop nugget you sang to me offers soaring waves of keyboard as anthony makes his amorous declarations with breathy urgency sexy salsa king rides the crossover wave label not so wonderful i thought this would be wonderful to keep the wipes warm so as not to shock the bottom of my son at diaper changes i was mistaken however the wipes we either dry or soaking wet and never really that warm not worth your money if you ask me label mine broke i bought of these one for upstairs and one for downstairs in my home the top lid broke on both of them i would not recommend this product look for one a little more sturdy than this label no more am screaming from cold wipes my daughter loves the warm wipes and my husband and i love that we don t have to listen to her scream when a cold wipes touches her especially at am they can dry out a little but the directions tell you to add a little water label mine quit retracting after the thrid use this thing is of mediocre quality at best mine quit retracting within the first week of using it label good everyday cage cleaner poop-off works well for everyday cage cleaning and can be used on almost everything perches cage bars and grate and even on the walls next to the cage dried hardened parrot droppings clean up easier if the product is sprayed on and left to sit for a few seconds helps make cleanups faster and easier label ranma the fifth book of rumiko takahashi s ranma continues the on going plot of ranma a boy who can change into a girl using cold water of course this brings up all sorts of strange and funny situations the fifth volume is no different it is still is some of the best and most classic of takahashi s work it s very funny and outragious if love ranma or your just an anime fan this book would be great to add to your collection label my daughter loves it yes the boy doll can only really fit into the lifeguard or doctor but my year old daughter puts the doctor or lifeguard outfits on the girls too they re just a little loose but she doesn t even notice however she is a little sad that the boy can t wear any of the other clothes but i don t think she s lost sleep over it since the boy doll is a little larger than the girl dolls she s so obsessed about being a doctor one day that she s thrilled she gets to dress them up in a doctor outfit she loves it label murder can singe your old flame this is a great book and fits well into the series i love desiree who is very down to earth and real label worst sound ever i could have produced a better quality sound back in the day with a pioneer cassette deck actually i did record and produce better sounding material around the same time as these recordings with a st generation cassette deck potential buyers should notice there is no way to sample the selections now i know why buyers beware of this product whether this is a defective product or unlistenable c p someone should be held accountable for this out and out ripoff label the movies are includes five digitally remastered full length feature films swamp women women in cages the big bust out and the hot box bonus movie high school big shot label shipping was fantastic but quality of product was very disappointing purchased item expecting it to be of same quality as my other laguiole knives not even close so very disappointed with the knives if you ve ever had the pleasure of owning the real mccoy you d know the difference in a heartbeat i thought they d make a nice addition for everyday toour other knives so very sorry i wasted my hard earned money on this cheap imitation label a film about patriotic duty vs love based on a famous thai novel by tommayanti sunset at chaopraya aka khu gam has been made into a multilingual film set in thailand during wwii it s a story about kobori a japanese soldier who unquestioningly takes command of an army base in a region called thonburi as instructed by his superiors but finds himself emotionally struggling with his new role and his sense of duty as well as his deep attraction for a thai woman named angsumalin overall a pretty good film for those who like emotional rollercoasters initially the beginning is slow but as it progresses you want to know how it turns out kind of reminds you of a certain jane austen story but to mention the name would spoil the film label impressed clarinet student i recently played the weber concerto in a competition and bought the recording to help me with it weber is an incredible composer and i have found this cd to be inspiring and entertaining it s a great set label this book is insane the book has a big problem in formualing how to go about doing different accounting calcuations the language is not clear and the diagrams are useless because there is no references as how the calculation came to be most of the time it starts on six pages back and if you do not read very carefully you will miss the whole idea had this book for two quarters in college and hated it all of the students that were in my classes came to the agreement that the authors could not agree and that the exericses were a disaster as well if you buy this book and totally understand it kudos label book sucks this book is gayest thing ever i have to google every thing in the book to get it properly the author must be a virgin label review of getting your next job this book demonstrates a practical straightforward approach to job hunting it s particularly useful to those facing unemployment or simply contemplating a career change the section which covers c v s is particulary strong despite there being a large number of books which cover similar topics i believe this book approaches the subject in a new nd refreshing way label is helping me i read this book as a companion to her messies manual book i find that they fit beautifully together i needed to understand that i m not just a lazy slob or a hopeless failure at making a home i have a personality that is shared by many other wonderful women learning to work with and not against myself has given me help and hope i agree if you are looking for a how to organize your home this won t meet your needs if you have tried and failed at homemaking and need to figure yourself and your needs out this is a great place to come i feel it needs the companionship of the messies manual to be complete i d buy and read it first label a dream of a book the extraordinary care that was taken by the publisher in the production and design of this book goes beyond beauty the weight proportions paper and typography are something like the experience of the original or at least of what the experience of reading was in the time of colonna this all helps illuminate the hallucinatory allegorical text and for this reader i felt as if i was inhaling some kind of ether what breathtaking insight this book provides into the sensibility and mileu of the renaissance label poorly written not informative this book was a real disappointment i do not recommend it to anyone interested in the pueblo revolt there are much better books on the subject available the pueblo revolt the secret rebellion that drove the spaniards out of the southwest the pueblo revolt bison book andpo pay leader of the first american revolution check out the above titles and skip this one label it s like a cd that hasn t finished completion like in departure here it comes bad all r e m songs are solid unities of pure listening enjoyment and i am a very big r e m fan but this is a r e m cd not made by r e m and that s what is wrong even as only-instrumental music it isn t as good as the originals but i guess that in the end it s nice to hear the nice tunes of these classic songs but it s lacking stipe and mills beautiful voices buck s superb guitar technique s and berry s drums only for die-hard r e m fans who want everything that s r e m related maybe it can be used in the elevator of the r e m clubhouse label finally finally a book about magic from someone other than the usual suspects saying something other than the usual my only complaint is that the book is sometimes difficult to read because i find myself stopping after individual essays to go for long walks and digest some essays i find myself stopping after almost every sentence to think about what i ve just read i particularly like louv s writing and ideas there s a deep-down freshness to his writing and oh gosh enthusiasm that i can t stop loving label rock n surf raw energic punk as well as smooth relaxed surf both sides of this record are excellent both made me happy that rock music is still alive so if you like rock or surf or simply rock n surf instumental music don t miss this one label wonderfully relaxing and highly enjoyable there are lovely tracks on this cd most are simply grand flute music by numerous st american artists some include chants that seem to stay with you throughout the day it s great to listen to read inspiring books by and meditate to highly recommended especially for those enamored with flute music label kinda compelling this cd takes singer-songwriters work to slightly somewhere else part of the time it sounds like chris isaak singing unknown tim buckley songs the other songs veer totally into pj harvey territory by the end he is combining the two approaches kinda compelling and someone to watch david garza fans might like this too label schubert goethe-lieder fischer-dieskau demus moore songs of a legendary composer and lyricist by one of the best singers ever definitely worth hearing also received quickly and in fine condition which is typical for amazon label great relaxing cd i picked this cd up in a small record shop while on vacation in santa fe new mexico years ago the music is wonderful very peaceful and relaxing nice pan flute i hope this group continues to make more cds i will get their other cd titled turquoise visions label wonderful wish maybe it could happen book just a beautiful book not only in appearance but in content open up this book on a january day in the dead of winter and dream dream dream of course as the author states dreaming is the beginning it opens up all the possibilities and options for one s own retreat i enjoyed it immensely as i m sure you will live life to it s fullest label quality product quick delivery i ordered the vw02-aux a week ago and i just received it the install was quick and harmless vw gti it took me about minutes to have everything completed the sound quality that you get from the unit is flawless i have it hooked up to my android phone and its just like listening to my cd s quality product quick delivery label turrible this product seemed like a good idea was doing half swings indoors at first then finally took it outside and did a full swing the dang thing broke off and flew and hit my buddys headlight like the title says turrible label socially relevant and street i was really feeling his wordplay on stay troop nowadays rappers can t rap but dude is solid label awesome track i love this track and the darda cars go so super fast the only thing is you have to hold down the track i m going to mount it on a piece of plywood label stupid waste of money fill a spray bottle with water add a squirt of dishwashing liquid and a teaspoon or two of liquid laundry detergent that contains enzymes trust me cheap and it works just as well buy your bird a toy with the money you save label a must for bird owners this product makes husbandry easier and quicker i have been using it for geez probably years or so and can t say enough about it it s pleasant smelling quick acting non-toxic and makes clean up a breeze you need this product if you have a caged bird label tree frogs delightful little board book that shows tree frogs up close and personal excellent photography label destroys stereotypes of medieval peasants this book does a great job of getting straight to the peasants themselves and depicting their lives as much as possible instead of lumping them together as all equally miserable brutish callous etc label a good solid romance who said that boys can t like a happy ending romance because i really enjoyed this book although i thought that some of the characters were a little extreme anyway i really like this manga but i can t show it to my guy-friends label awful thank goodness i rented this movie before actually buying it it wasn t even funny at all i am greatly disappointed and thought it was going to be good the creators really missed a lot of opportunities to make a fantastic movie label figured it would suck but it didn t after seeing the trailers on tv for this quite a while ago i figured it would be a cheesy movie with a few one liners boy was i wrong it surprised me from the beginning and i can still laugh while thinking of a few parts of it now i don t even like cameron diaz but in this she does great not one for kids though i still won t let mine watch but i m strict like that label terrible st off cameron diaz was grossly miscast in this role there were probably dozens of actresses who could have played this role better how does she keep getting job after job after job she s an awful actress at best now i like funny and sexy as much as anyone but these jokes were just downright crude and not even a little bit funny this makes the seth rogen-type comedies look like gone with the wind although all the roles were bad justin timberlake did the best job in his rising slightly above the rest of the pig slop proving he was actually too good to lend his name to this trash its lucky to get a one-star rating here as you can t dish out zero stars avoid at all costs label bad movie i don t know how cameron diaz ever agreed to do this crap the writing is horrible and the acting is worse label bad teacher dvd purchased as a gift for an adult fun movie shipped fast arrived in perfect condition great price didn t have to fight the crowds in the stores label minute trailer far better than the entire film i had been wanting to see this movie since i saw the previews since seeing it i could have just as well stuck with the previews it was as if someone filmed short clips and stuck them together there were many parts of the film that did not transition very well and there was very little chemistry between the actors in the movie to keep this short i will not be watching this movie again label bad teacher bad movie i just finished watching this really bad movie and thought i d jump over to amazon and see what others thought of it not surprised that there are more star ratings for this than stars can t believe c diaz actually read the script before shooting this and still continued her career is really in a tailspin after this kind of crap there s the good part of hollywood and then there s this if amazon had a way to award star that s what it s worth maybe not even that much what s next for diaz a tv sitcom wouldn t be surprised label surprisingly funny yes this movie is raunchy and over the top but i loved it there are awkward parts and it is r rated for a reason but this is the best comedy i ve seen all year don t take it seriously and you ll love it label a pleasant surprise a reluctant teacher loses her wealthy fianc and thus has to return to the job she hates desiring breast implants she pursues the bonus awarded to the teacher whose class has the highest test scores along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher tries to connect with a rich substitute and finds a rival in a fellow teacher the funniest and most well-developed character in the film this is a movie that i found funny and refreshing in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout this is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator a pleasant surprise label the reviews are correct this movie stinks this is one of those movies where you think wonder perhaps hope that all of the negative review are wrong because there are well know actors in this film but this film proves again and again that famous actors lousy writing lousy movie please save yourself some time and money pass on this complete dud label bad is accurate for this stinker this is easily one of the worst movies i ve ever seen thankfully i am just out the cost for rental and didn t buy the dvd or see it in the theater rather than come up with any remotely funny dialogue the writers just pile on f-bombs or worse the only reason i watched to the end was to see how much worse it could continue to get the great justin timberlake and jason segal are totally wasted the gorg cameron diaz should fire her agent do yourself a favor and run away from this humorless turd label bad more like terrible there was nothing fun or funny about this movie i knew the reviews weren t good but i thought there had to be at least some enjoyable parts i was wrong there was no chemistry between cameron and the pe teacher i couldn t tell if justin t s character was that ridiculous or if it was just really poor acting there were zero likeable characters and no character development from watching the movie i had no understanding as to why the main character was so nasty to everyone did something happen to her as a child a little background would be nice overall pointless label bad teacher bad is right after the first half hour had to turn it off life is way to short i wouldn t waste your money on buying it rent it first if at all label should be rated x first of all to anyone that thinks this movie is supposed to be deep realistic and taken seriously don t i don t believe it was meant to be taken seriously however it s still not funny yea it has a few giggle moments here there but most of the scenes made no sense weak plot too many scenes that tried too hard it wasn t necessarily boring but simply not funny the dry humping scene was extra totally unnecessary the teachers other than cameron diaz were torture to watch seems like a lot of things were just thrown together at the last minute from the producer i recommend ages older only to watch anyone younger is just inappropriate it suits young adults who need a brainless movie to watch while high on marijuana label disappointing i couldn t muster enough faith in the story to prod any longer than page i found it difficult to relate to sympathize with or even respect the characters they were intolerable existing only to drive the plot the book professes to extol the principles of cultural tolerance and individual sensitivity but it fails in this as it attempts to bridge ethnic gender racial economic generational and especially the individual divide the characters are pigeonholed in stereotyped behavior manner and thought a stilted performance of a highly advertised and acclaimed book label disappointing anne tyler seems to have lost her joy i was most disappointed with this new book from anne tyler and i would agree with some of the other reviewers who think she s lost her special gift her characters have lost their endearing quirky edge and their sense of humor who can ever forget the man who washed his dress shirts at the end of his day by stomping around on them while taking a shower or the family that always put the groceries away in exact alphabetical order i could go on an on in her last few books however her characters have pretty much fallen flat i fear that this change to more serious humorless stories is a relection of her own life it seems that since her husband died her stories have suffered i hope she will rediscover her old witty truly joyful view of life and bring us back some of her mesmerizing quirky characters i await her next book with great hope label good book digging to america by anne tyler is a most enjoyable read our book club is usually into heavy stuff and it was delightful to read something that wasn t a downer anne tyler writes simply and directly she can capture a scene and emotion with few articulate well chosen words i laughed out loud at the binky party the main character is really maryam who is searching for belonging as is almost everybody else in the book you ll enjoy this book it s not a great book but one that can generate some good discussion label boring i have to rank this with the top ten most boring books i have ever read it s my first anne tyler book and there would have to be a pretty good argument for picking up another of her books the characters in this book were so uninteresting i couldn t connect with one character practically the whole book is about planning a party or attending a party after the first party i pretty much decided that attending a party with these people would be torture the underlying themes had the promise of making this an explosive book but they were just left dead on the pages while the characters and parties bored me to tears label great writer but surprisingly dull and uninvolving book i ve read every anne tyler book and usually enjoy them and always find them readable but this one i haven t finished it yet isn t very compelling a week or more goes by before i pick it up and i think i m just going to have to set aside a few hours and get it out of the way which is a horrible thing to say about a writer i enjoy so much neither the characters nor the plot are compelling to me just seems like dinners and lunches at one anothers homes the charactersher strong pointseem flat and without a strong plot to move things along it just ain t moving along label characters in search of a plot as an avid reader of fiction and non-fiction about the transracial adoptive experience i was immediately drawn to the subject matter of this book however i was disappointed and surprised at how the author failed to create momentum or at the very least a forward moving plot much description was given with no action mainly reading like the background biographies of the characters rather than details that are integrated into a developed story most distressing is the lack of three dimensionality to the children themselves a list of physical attributes and behavioral tics do not make them come alive i am a true sucker for any kind of family formed by adoption story let alone one with the outlines of this book as it mirrors my own family but the fact that i didn t feel moved at all signals to me an unconvincing and inauthentic rendition of this experience label romance politics the devil s paw a novel of espionage and intrigue during world war i is very dated in light of subsequent historical events but it is facinating nonetheless there is a moderate amount of suspense and action from the main characters but the thrust of the novel is a study of the political climate of england at that time julian orden son of a british aristocrat and vocal espouser of the socialist cause attends a dinner party and meets catherine a young woman of mixed antecedentsbritish and russian in her face he recognizes the person who saved his life on the beach the night before these two characters become caught up in a plan by the leaders of the working people of germany and england to force a premature end to world war i i enjoyed this book but unless you are interested in the philosophy of british politics and the position of socialism in that era i would suggest another choice label does not work as advertised got this flash to work with nikon s cls as a remote unit before purchase i called sigma to ask if it would do this was assured that yes it would does not work as advertised or as sigma tech support assured me it would i run sb-s and two sb-s so i know how to use the system save your self time and money and buy a true nikon unit label excellent resource this was a required text for one of my classes in my credential program and i ended up using it throughout my entire credential program it has a very detailed perspective on teaching to a diverse classroom and gives some excellent pointers on the developmental levels of different aged students i found the concepts and ideas to be beneficial comprehensive and ideal i would certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to expand their knowledge and insights into the diverse classroom label biased writer this book was required for one of my courses while earning my teacher certification i noticed that the author works at my university so i m not too surprised that it was required and not just recommended the author mark ryan is very biased in his view of education to him there is no place in a classroom for traditional teaching styles it should be an open student-directed learning environment where the teacher is a guide on the side my th grade daughter is suffering through this type of teaching right now and i can tell you that leaning too much one way or the other isn t good when will the education community learn to use a little bit of all types of teaching philosophies rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water if required to read this text do so with a grain of salt don t become another victim of teacher certification indoctrination like this author is label ask the teacher i bought this book for my teaching credential program i found it very interesting and have used it as a reference for all my classes mark ryan provides helpful information for teaching and provides different strategies to use in the diverse classroom the book is straighforward and versatile it presents concise and positive advice about teaching and learning a must have book for students and teachers to keep in their library label informative this book blows what to expect when you re expecting away it is very informative and includes a page journal for each month so you can keep track of how you feel etc i highly recommend this book do not waste your money on what to expect the pregnancy book by the dr sears is also wonderful label best progressive trance mix of the s the songs on this cd more than any other defined the evolution of the west coast trance and techno scene in the late s his mixtape contact is even better a california desert rave is being delivered to your cd player enjoy label if i could give this book stars i would i knew it would be bad from the moment i saw it because who in their right mind would want to esape from witchcraft wicca is a great religon and it is not about worshiping the devil witches worship god dont waste your money label very educational if you enjoy weather prediction this is a fantastic book from a premier authority the only problem the book we received was edition old it s still a good book label i was definately utterly confused this book is written by my current teacher he has done a fantastic job of highlighting and condensing the most essential information that is critical for each chapter also some of the information contained in the testing area of the book is actually on his tests that are provided through mcgraw hill connect label i didn t love it this story of grace o rourke and rathe bragg was my second-least favorite book of the very talented brenda joyce the absolute worst was runaway bride which i didn t bother to finish after just a few chapters this book was very unsatisfying and highly predictable while rathe was somewhat interesting grace was very stereotypical and cliche in my opinion most of joyce s fans look to her to really make the pages sizzle with passionate heat and sadly this book fell short and it fell hard none of the love scenes were endearing or worthwhile is this the same author that wrote the fires of paradise on a more positive note joyce s use of the deep south during the horrible aftermath of slavery was a very promising backdrop for an excellent story the plot did not stand up to the setting and the romance between the main characters was dry and inspired very little emotion from the reader if you love stories set in the deep south you may be able to find some enjoyment out of it label best knife ever a nice hefty feel a big blade quality usa craftmanship and beautiful materials i love it so much i immediately bought more this is truly an heirloom item you won t be disappointed label disappointing i bought this cd based on all the positive reviews i found it to be insipid weak and flat it only contains one cut worth playing more than once i miss you madly very much background or elevator muzak i was hoping to find something new and fresh like another comment stated just a watered down earl klugh wannabee save your money for earl label soothing guitar my first introduction to lawrence barris came after hearing loveland from this cd a few years back i own both of lawrence s cds and i think this one is far better than his love on me cd all the songs feature that soft and soothing guitar accented by keyboards and percussion my favorite is still loveland but other good songs include our midnight dance sometime somewhere and afternoon samba this cd is definitely worth checking out label you need training or just be honest i ordered this item and received different sizes of baking dishes instead of this one i returned them with an explaination in the box and again received the same baking dishes i talked with the amazon people and they said that it was a miss write on the description and that they were fixing it as we were talking they credited my account a week later i checked for the item i wanted and there it was no different than when i first ordered it i really wanted this item and it seems that they can t deliver i will order it from lehman s catalog this item is cheaper through them anyway i will reconsider purchasing any items that go through target they also indicated that they would send me a free gift for the inconvenience never got it anchor hocking oven basics glass baking dish trio label not very well built i bought this showerhead months ago and when i installed it i threw away the warranty information as i didn t consider it necessary how often do plumbing type parts fail not often or at all based on my past experience well much to my shock this showerhead has in less than months time developed a crack in it now i have to go through the trouble of finding the warranty information on it not a well built product to develop a crack so soon found my warranty information called them and they sent a replacement piece it has held up so far so i m raising the rating on this product from a to a as the manufacturer was prompt on the replacement part and it is holding up label making a trap way too complex what is the matter with you you take a simple trap and make a bunch of loose parts doesn t work very poor design and build should be a door that locks and a cage so they cant get out kiss keep it simple stupid label full of errors i found this book very superficial for the most part an exploration of george s spirituality is an interesting subject but there were so many errors in this book that i began to question what was fact or or fiction in discussions of george s spiritual life label all that jazz volume i had looked all over for this cd after i was about to give up i checked amazon com it was located without any trouble at all the delevery was faster than i expected the cd is great amazon com was great along with the vender that sold the cd label another entry for the same cd see my review under the disc s other entry where you might find it cheaper as well john foulds seven essays in the modes etc label inspiring i found sailing by grace to be very inspiring not only is this book a collection of wonderfully written poems but the author has taken the time to include a biblical truth that applies to each of his poems his opening comments challenge the reader and put the poem in context to be enjoyed to its fullest truly a work of art from a man who loves his lord his family his church and those whom he has had the privilege of impacting i highly recommend this book label sandy shines over the other material moments a track on the cd is said to be sandy s last recording it is exquisite and worth the cost of the cd which otherwise is not memorable and at times bothersome as trevor lucas voice is very pedestrian compared with sandy s label bad these mats are poorly designed made because the plastic is warped and there is no way to securely attach them to concrete even with stickies label not so smart parking mat the mats move as the tire rolls over the first bump this makes them useless as garage parking markers label simply beautiful me and my husband gave this book to each other on our wedding day which was april we both just love these poems the poems are reminding us of how special the little thing in life are and how simple it really is to make each other happy if you are willing to make an effort for it i can really recommend this book to everybody who wants to buy a romantic and useful present for the person you share your life with useful because the poems are like guidelines for a succesful marriage this is a great valentine s day of anniversary present label buy simple secrets of happy people instead this book is very boring and i had a hard time continuing to read it it is one of the worst books i have ever read with very little valuable information simple secrets of happiness is excellent and enjoyable and has a lot of quick valuable nuggets with no star reviews please read the other star reviews this book has by others before buying this book label amazing and inspiring this is arguably the best of iylana s books this book touched me as it was a combination of ms vanzant s personal anguish trial and tribulations as well as her own victories coupled with the thought-provoking inspiration for which she is famous interiors is a story of one woman s personal journey through some of life s darkest valleys and in facing these demons she rises like a phoenix into the realm of self-actualization self-love and most importantly self-respect although interiors is an autobiographical journey of iylanla vanzant s life it can be applicable to anyone who has experienced pain in their own life it is guaranteed to touch some aspect of each reader in an intimately close manner through her pain and suffering ms vanzant opens up a path of nurturing and healing like none other reviewed by nedine hunterof the rawsistaz reviewers label not very useful the book does have a lot of great examples but that s it just examples it shows you what the author created and then how he did it it is not very practical for creating your own dhtml scripts if you try to create something that he specifically didn t do you re lost with this book definitely not a reference book i just glanced through this thing then stuck it in my desk and haven t touched it since graphics are pretty cool though label not a good trap i read the husband and the wife trap and i really enjoyed both but i don t like the plot here how could the hero not see her as a beauty even before the makeover it seems that he was also shallow and only took notice of her with new hairstyle and gowns anyway here s the turn off and let s fast forward to the scene when he told eliza s cousin the villain to leave england permanently and even suggested to settle in france then on the epilogue he was telling her about a job that would require them to live in france how stupid was that were they following pettigrew that they were going to be in the same place with the villain and might even crossed path again come on where was your common sense kit or better yet ms warren label dissapointing figure for an awesome character jazz was my favorite character in the movie unfortunitly it seems the fate of his toy is on par with his fate in the movie this sculpt makes jazz look fat and dumpy his hands are half-inch spikes of plastic that do nothing but fold out on mine the head would not fully pop out the fold-down wheels at the feet just look silly his telescoping sword is a cheap cop-out for a weapon along with his spoiler supposedly doubling as a shield the grey plastic looks horribly dull jazz is suppose to be about style and cool not dull vehicle mode looks ok i would pass on this guy label healthy and yummy an oldie but a goodie book arrived promptly from a private seller the recipes are healthy and yummy it is possible to prepare and consume foods that benefit our bodies and brains and this book will help you do that recommend highly label the game plan this is an amazing review of history and a blue print of the end this book outlines the agenda of civilization and it s dire consequence you can t help from not seeing this play out through the current events of today communisum is alive and well label just a bad printer i really want to like lexmark i live in lexington hometown of lexmark hq all printers are made in china and mexico but this is the last one i will ever buy it is just bad all around feeder jams on just about anything you put in it the software is convoluted and confusing and i work for a technology company the print quality is decent but the picture quality isn t good enough for printing photos which is one of the primary reasons i purchased the printer finally the wireless connectivity doesn t work right and required me to physically unplug the printer anytime i wanted to print frustrating i ended up moving it so i could hard wire the machine about the only positive i can think of is that it looks nice when it isn t printing take my advice buy something else label wifi doesn t cut it i bought this for the wifi capability but it goes down constantly if you disconnect reconnect the power it usually works but if i have to get up to do that what is the point in having wireless the printer also tells you that you are out of ink way before you actually are other than that it has been alright web support is horrible and based on the reviews i am not even going to attempt to call tech support i m going to hook it up with usb until i can afford a new printer label job well done i attended junior high school with denetria she was singing then and she s still singing this album is wonderful and i am looking forward to hearing her future projects label lighthearted mystery this is a fun lighthearted mystery with lots of colorful offbeat characters and greenwich village atmosphere the sleuth is a milliner and while she s solving crimes she s also designing next season s hat collection label phonics read rhyme really awful program i only purchased it because the school also uses it the karoke section makes no sense and it says to play a song but then none of the buttons are enabled to play one i called tech support and they said this is the way it s supposed to work until the child accumulates tickets my daughter accumulated all of the tickets but it still doesn t play any songs in the clubhouse label takes my breath away this disk is a truly amazing achievement it combines heart-felt prayer with unbelievably gorgeous music and provides an inspiring listening experience to my mind the most amazing thing about this music is its nearly universal appeal people who are not jewish find it compelling enough that they buy it and play it in their cars and at work i find it spiritually uplifting and musically accomplished there is another review here which describes the contents of the disk in detail so i won t do that instead i will just say that i loved this disk the first time i listened to it and i like it more on each repetition label wife likes it but the color is a little different than it looks on amazon like the look of it the actual product is red but it looks a different hue of red than the photo on amazon shows the color difference wasn t disappointing to us but we weren t trying to match it to anything just liked the hawaiian look label horrible media player i bought this gameshark disk for the media player in hopes of playing mp3 s on my ps2 after numerous attempts with each attempt ending in the media player just freezing up i finally gave up i haven t looked at the other things on the disk but as far as the media player don t waste your money it is junk if it were possible i would give this product no stars based on the media player but then i haven t looked at the other stuff on the disk label disappointing looking for ways to extend my spanish i like buying instructional cds since i spend a lot of time in the car and it s a constructive use of that time about half of the conversations is on cd with no rhyme or reason as to what makes it to cd and what doesn t label have lots of scratches on it for whatever reason when i opened the package the color was falling apart on several spots although the spots are big but they can be covered with the clothes hanging on it not satisfied with my purchase label light use only i was originally very happy with this coat tree but i now wish that i had shelled out a bit more money for a more sturdy and better built one while it is easy to put together and provides easy access to all items with a revolving top the design is poor and does not handle much weight one of the legs broke away under stress after a month of use and because of the design is all but unrepairable without adding unsightly screws or straps for support the legs have notches which slide in to grooves in the bottom of the center pole and the notch on the leg is thin and easily breaks away also the base of the coat tree is too narrow which causes it to topple over if the weight is unevenly distributed i attempted to use it with winter coat jackets a full length dress coat and hooded sweatshirts and ended up having to redistribute the items often label cheap bought this coat rack to hold coats by the door for the winter within the first week the support leg broke from the cheap construction of the leg supports i would not waste your money on this rack label outdated and slow leading to little magic seeing as there are many other effecient and productive magical systems avaliable for study it baffles me as to why anybody would want to waste their time crawling along with this one if you want to actually do some magic rather than simply considering it or stopping short of really trying it as this course does then look elsewhere i suggest donald michael kraig s superb modern magick if the gd tradition appeals at least kraig s book gets to the heart of the whole point for doing it in the first place unlike this volume which only discusses it in scared little whispers magic has moved on and it s time that fact was recognised once and for all so don t buy this book unless you like the picture on the cover label this book is liberating to women everywhere this book is liberating to women everywhere the reason i bought this intriguing book was that my grandmother didi moorman is actually in the book pgs label love this idea great idea my kids were so excited to turn them on and brush the whole time they are a bit hard to turn on for my and year old so i have to do it for them no big deal they are at target for stock up why they are on amazon is a mystery to me what a rip off label amazing i was able to set it up in less than minutes i bought this item for my office for occasional watching of news or special event and to replace my b w tv i was able to install this in minutes and it works extremely well i can watch tv in a resizable window while working the picture qyality is acceptable on full screen but excellent in a by window sound quality very good the only thing that worries me it that the unit gets very hot but it has vent holes all over for keeping it cool so maybe it is supposed to get that hot i have not tried recording a program yet but reading other reviews i understand it maybe a problem but for after mail-in-rebate from buy com it is far superior than my b w tv with poor sound and flickering picture i am going to give a proper burial to the b w tv soon and reduce clutter on my desk label it died very fast it only worked a coouple of times and then it just stoped not a very good product label must have don t be afraid of factory reconditioned mine arrived packed and perfect just like a new one except much less expensive this is a great tool all around the crown stops and vertical clamp should be included i ve taken the skin off my knuckles when i let one finger outside of the handle when lowering the blade it gets caught by the blade guard and takes flesh right off minus star for the blade guard removing my skin unecessarily label nothing wrong with reconditioned seems to work great i don t use it for a lot of heavy duty stuff but for what i have used it for i can t find any problems only negative might be the dust catcher it doesn t seem to work very well but i haven t ever seen one that does so i still give it stars label nearlyweds beth kendrick is one of the few writers i ll read in the chick lit genre and that is because her ideas are original she stays away from a lot of this genre s cliches and this book is no exception it s great for a quick and fun read label its wires pretty hard to f up wires everything in the description is there in the package quality of insulation on wires could be better none other issues label terrible this was the worst experience with this seller trough amazon the item was damaged used and dirty i ve tried contacting the seller and she just blew me off buyer beware label beware of headliner no balls come with this order the balls work great if you can find them beware of this sellers false headliner the miracle ball method relieve your pain reshape your body reduce your stress miracle balls included paperback no balls come with this order and then your are stuck with a book that is not worth sending back label don t buy this product from alternate new and used sources i have used this product and been very happy in the past i gave my set away and wanted to replace it so visited the amazon site my mistake was ordering from another source through amazon and although they show the product description as same with miracle balls included only a book arrived i can tell you that you do not get the same results rolling around on the book the small balls make all the difference be sure that the product description is accurate i was told by seller that they would not accept return label some relief from back pain i have some knots and general tightness in my back and was looking for something that might be helpful i considered some of the back alignment products but hesitated because of the price since it costs a fifth of the price of a single massage i decided to try this product i ve only used it a short time but feel that it has made a small positive difference label works great i am a dog groomer and my muscles really take a beating my massage therapist told me about these and how i should use them as maintenece wow am i glad she did my neck and shoulder doesn t freeze up and i can work without pain label cured my year stiff neck by placing one ball under my neck and rolling my neck around for a few minutes i am able to turn my neck while driving without feeling the usual stiffness and pain in fact i can roll my head in almost any direction without neck pain for the first time in at least years to work the sides of my neck i placed one ball on a tailor s ham used in sewing so that my shoulder would have room while laying on my side with the ball fully supporting the side of my neck after minutes of gentle rolling my neck on each side i have no side neck pain for the first time in decades i can t recommend this product enough label not as i expected i was so hopeful that this would work when i used the balls i found it painful and was very sore the next day might not be for people with fibromyalgia i might try again but i m a little wary label these little balls did very little to help my pain i am disappointed with this product most of the exercises are basic stretches which do not require the balls the balls do feel good while using them but do not provide relief beyond that in fact i m not so sure that they don t make painful areas worse the smell of the balls is horrendous i have no idea why everyone has written so many good reviews i ve had several of my friends try them out also and they think that they re just a waste of time i would certainly not purchase again label great invention these balls do what they are supposed to do-relieve back pain love them gave a set to my brother-n-law who has back issues and they did the trick label this music requires an almost supernatural technique composer godowsky has beautifully augmented the etudes of chopin adding textures and even extra melody lines with just two hands expected to somehow play it all carlo grante is a very good pianist but this music requires amazing dexterity this is a noble attempt but too often grante is forced to break the rhythm and fluidity of the pieces in order to accomodate the extra material many of the pieces are simply played too slowly imagine chopin etudes plodding like dinosaurs like someone s got a thumb on the record marc-andre hamelin has the supernatural technique to play these pieces well grante plays some of the studies well enough it s interesting to hear him attempt some of the most complex pieces ever written but perhaps he needs another few years of practice someone wrote that grante has re-recorded these pieces for release this year it should be very interesting to see what eight extra years of practice has yielded label nonsense grante has no idea at all of style appropriate to this idiom most of these are unrecognizable no sense of texture tone legato or anything else that would have meant anything to godowsky check out godowsky s american records e g the berceuse not the columbias to hear what i mean as bad as i ve heard since szidon s hysterical scriabin or pollini s brutal chopin no bueno really no stars at all label good place to start although a bit outdated especially s far as examples and tables are concerned this book is still a good starting point for those who wants to begin with their research in astro economics and astro trading for example if you have never read an ephemeris table before then section two of the book will explain you how to do it one important point this book makes reference to moving planets aspects and their correlation with turning points in the market it has little to do with financial astrology here you will not find corporations horoscopes first trade dates or stuff like that another observation this books is very simple to understand the author writes about astronomical cycles without mentioning equations signals theory and celestial mechanics concepts great for beginners maybe this a limit for those more into this subject label excellent this is a wonderful cd of solo and chamber works by this composer it s amazing how much great music there is out there waiting to be discovered this guy s music is amazing it really pulled me in and captivated me it is approachable with lots of excitement but also tons of heart i m hooked highly recommended label technical errors there are so many books how-to books out there on mosaic technique some are accurate clearly based on extensive practical knowledge and experience and some have very misleading and incorrect information i m afraid this book falls in the former category when an author mentions using elmers craft glue to create a mosaic or seal a substrate then i would hesitate to trust any of the other information in the book for a proven how-to book on creating mosaics i would suggest mosaic techinques and traditions by sonia king or any of the books by emma biggs tessa hunkin or elaine goodwin these are all working mosaic artists and instructors and the techniques they share can be counted on to provide you with a solid foundation in this wonderful art form label great calming liquid i got a rescue dog and for the first few days he was very difficult when i left he would bark and howl for hours my rescue contact suggested that i try good boy after one day of adding it to his water he became totally different slept like a baby while i was gone and when i got home was back to normal it seemed like i was drugging him b c it was so effective but he is very normal and active whenever i was around odd after a few days i decided to stop putting it in his water b c i was worried that it was too much but after that he just stayed calm all the time i think it helped him make the transition to being in a new house with a new owner ever since then he has been just fine and not hyper active anymore it really saved the day for me and him i recommended it to my friends with over-active dogs and i m waiting to hear what they say after they buy it for their dogs label spell binding civil war stories great collection of classic and some little known tales from a terrific story teller a master of irony descriptiveness and sucker-punching endings you won t be sorry label i came back to waterpik i had owned a waterpik showerhead in my previous house when i moved into this house months ago i purchased a different brand to save a few dollars i finally went back to waterpik and i can comfortably say it is definitely worth the few extra dollars label my son loves this book my son is months and loves this book this says a lot since i can t get him to hold still to change his diaper yet he will sit and let me read him this book over and over great for learning bye-bye peek a boo and mama dada and the pop-up baby elmo at the end is great and always gets a baby laugh i am actually going to buy a couple of copies as gifts as well as some of the other books in the series i highly recommend this book label makes me laugh had to have it laughed when i first saw it it s been outside my door for two weeks now and still looks good may not last a very long time because of the light color but it was a good purchase for me label not the real book i thought this was the real book but it was just the study guide make sure to buy the actual book not the study guide label they say it is in stock not so today i get this email from antonlinewe are so sorry to inform you stock has not arrived as planned for your purchase in our warehouse setup to ship to your location we are expecting a re-supply truck to arrive with more stock in business days we will ship your order then if you can accept this small delay please reply to this email letting us know that it is ok to ship when the stock arrives thanks for your order and understanding this small delay the support team at antonlinethe website seed that the item was in stock so i ordered it to replace a power supply in my server i expected it to ship today there now emailing me saying that it is not in stock label tells the true story i think that this book was a great example of a true biography of a person ricky martin is a great preformer who has only been on this earth for such a short time and has already achived so much sucess with much more to come this book portrays his life in a great light and allows the reader to feel as if they know ricky after reading this book it is not a teen bopper book about ricky but rather a window into his exciting and sometimes heart breaking life s story label large butter knife knife arrived dull with an uneven edge i ll never buy a another premium grade knife without be able to physically check the edge i wanted a large sharp hunting knife for the upcoming moose season and what i got was a very attactive dull knife that i can t get to take an edge i thought i was safe buying from buck but i guess quality is a thing of the past label incredable junk after owning this knife for about a year the hanle broke off this cheeseball piece of buck trash i paid alot for this unit just to have it break on me and if you repair there knife so you can use it that voids the buck warranty it costs buck almost nothing to produce this cheeseball pile of drivle up yours buck i would not take this with me into the woods or steelhead fishing you want a knife you can depend on and buck is not it that is the first and last buck i will ever own or purchase i have a cheap survival knife from china that i paid for and it has really held up with no problems whatsoever and it holds an edge very well for what i paid for the cheeseball buck trash knife i could buy six survival knives that would last several lifetimes buck sucks lets repeat that buck sucks this is the worst company i have ever dealt with bad warranty extremely bad products and you still suck the big one buck label best knife ever i am a jusat a regular guy like most of you who are reading this my older brother bought me this knife years ago for my first trip to bwca i v gone the following years as well i love this knife i still bring a gerber multi-tool but there is no matching my buck knife it does everything and i mean everything it has good weight a great sheath and holds it s edge i have totally abused this knife and it still looks and works incredible there is no better knife for the money i am a regular guy from wisconsin and this is my honest opinion fyi my dad also has this knife from over years ago from when we used to live in alaska and it is also still in great shape label good game bad graghics the game is good but grghics bad you know i like the game style because i played all the old versions but it is fun to play label doesn t get any better what fun it was to sit with my child just minutes a day and watch her become a reader in short order label more than i espected great read what an awesome book it was more than i expected and in such good condition i use it as a referance in my studies has shed a greater deepth of the bible in the days of genesis label latin pap an ok singing voice with a lot of bland orchestral wallpaper i really don t like this kind of format generally i could hardly believe the height of the praise in most of the other reviews never heard luis miguel before but because of other latin sounds i had quite high expectations be sure you know what you re getting before you buy this label classical luis miguel yes i have heard the critics but let s get real this is luis miguel s style and why should he change into something he s not he s more frank sinatra than he is elvis presley and you know what he is comfortable with that this album is a great master piece and has the collaboration of such great composers as the argentine composer bebu silvetti and his mexican compatriot the master of such hits as it s impossible adore and yesterday i heard the rain the legendary armando manzanero this album celebrates love and not sexuality the songs that stand out in this album are sol arena y mar o tu y ninguna quiero dimelo en un beso and tu solo tu this album is a combination of pop jazz ballad classical woven together this album has up tempo songs and easy listening romantic songs overrall this is one of luis miguel s best albums and it includes songs written by the artist himself the mexican superstar did a job that he can be proud of label escuchar a luis miguel es un placer ana soto escribe cada canci n me hace sentir algo diferente todo relacionado con la pasi n el amor y la fuerza que luis miguel desprende cuando canta una canci n creo que es lo mejor que he escuchado de luis miguel en los a os que llevo siguiendole realmente es un placer escucharlo label this book explained a lot if you grew up with brothers and sisters you ll easily recognize yourself in this book as your position in the family is clearly and well identified based on your birth order this book will surprise you as a grown adult it was extremely interesting to read about the patterns that first born and other siblings exhibit in their lives and it explains that there can be more than one first born the author has really pegged this topic and i m confident that while you may not fit every pattern you ll find that you recognize yourself as you read it s a great read that we have lent others and received the same reviews label stars without testing hi i haven t bought this game yet but i want to and i am debating between this and uno but i think it s pretty good by the customer reviews i love video games but i am not too good with them so this would be a perfect challenge for me i think that the different levels would be a good challenge for everyone that loves or even likes video games i rate this four stars because i haven t played this yet but i think it s great label this game absolutely rocks this game is one of the best ones i have ever played on game boy nintendo playstation and game boy color it is challenging fun and has great graphics you can replay the levels you ve won in challenge battle with other players have your fortune told and even do bonus levels you have got to get this game peeps label good starter this book is best used for those people who do not know exactly how to put information together but do know what they want to add in thier essay if you do not have previous experience in anything and do not have a story well then this book is not for you it gives you great ideas to add into your essay but it does not spoon feed you the method the examples in the back are not the best but they help you draw out some ideas that you would not have otherwise remembered or deemed important label essays that get into law school most of these essays are garbage foreign to what most people need to know i m shocked that some of these people got into law school i m starting to figure out why the profession is a dying one and why no one respects it get another one or search deeper this is simply a pc book of garbage and generic information on how to write an essay that you learned your first two years as an undergrad label buck is synonomous with superb quality i purchased this knife as a more traditional pocket knife to carry on certain occasions it is honestly a bit heavy for pocket carry because it is sturdy and thick however that is why a sheath also comes with it regardless i am very happy with my purchase and would recommend buck knives to anyone who would want a quality knife label great for beginners to programming weak for actual developer this book is really the only book available so you have no choice right now this book was blatantly written for which may be ok it offers great simple examples but offers very little to no help for serious development light reading can finish the book in days label absolute junk it is ashame a reputable comany has not picked this idea up and made a quality dependable product out of it it is a priceless idea for the repairmen technicians the unit i received did not work on any drive it was just sweat shop made junk never tested or qa d it was even some generic product there was no name anywhere on the item or the box label doesn t work this device rarely if ever works it sometimes is recognized by the computer as being connected and then doesn t show the drive correctly i have tested this device on three different computers with different ide drives before i wrote this review label uck sabrent usb hi-speed usb to ide cable for inch inch inch drives devices with power adapterthis item is not compatable with inch drives as advertised label bad product tried this on a laptop drive drive powered up when connected to usb port but that is as far as it got never showed up on computer borrowed an external enclosure from a co-worker that worked just fine so it wasn t my laptop drive what a waste of money label perfect for tech geeks great for backing up i sure needed this thing my old pc burned out so i needed access to my hard drive and this is the solution for my needs it worked like a charm but my first try i shocked my first hard drive what i did was plug it in the wall and then to my hard dish it shocked it and killed that hard drive but i learned now you have to connect the usb to pc then the power supply to the hd then lastly to the wall so i ask any one that buys this to be careful it can be tricky if you don t knowlucky for my i tested it on a hard drive that was nt that important to me o and i also tryed it with my dvd burner and burned a movie with the burner connect to usb it rocksi think the power supply burnt out on me i guess thats because it s cheap im buying a better one one where the power supply has a on and off which label sabrent usb usb to ide cable good cable to use with spare hdds however for some reason the usb connector requires inserting and removing from the computer usb connector in order for computer to recognize the sabrent usb it is a little frustrating but it permits me to be able to use the several hdds that i have collected from old computers without spending too much money for individual external hdd cases label lame book waste of money what a rip off a st grader would be upset with this lazy primer don t waste your cash anyone who has ever had a basic medical term a p or hematology class could have written this did not learn anything to help with test i bought it based on earlier good reviews the author s relatives must have written them kathryn a kalanick phlebotomy technician specialist certification exam review also on amazon includes an excellent cd with study and test questions based on ascp amt and nca topics the book is very good detailed review sections with illustrations tests made a high score with this book i m not related to anyone connected with this book phlebotomy technician specialist certification exam review phlebotomy technician specialist certification exam review label good filter good filter it works excellent it was my first time i bought this brand i think is a excellent brand label blowing in the wind will they return magnificent flute music to keep the cobwebs away whether it is heard from the bustling kitchen or from the music room in a quiet moment a pity it is no longer available label peformance theory what is great and what is not in the electronic edition this is a great book and one that is indispensible for the theatre academic or practitioner i had it in paper and i decided to buy it kindle format for convenience there is one problem that i found in some of the kindle books graphics are not well scanned small fonts in the graphics are not readable label lacking in no doubt ronald shannon jackson had a challenge on his hand the decoding society had pretty much scattered and with the loss of such powerful musicians assembling a new band to succeed them was a difficult task the second generation decoding society guitarist cary denegris bassist reginald washington violinist akbar ali and saxaphonist eric person on this recording persons in conjunction with african singers percussionists twins seven seven the result of the collaboration while interesting lacks much of the fire that the older decoding society had by and large the pieces are invested in funky african rhythms they have a nice sound the playing is good all around particularly washington who adds a good slap funk sensibility and slithers nicely between jackson s rhythms but there s by and large something really quite unfulfilling about the record it just doesn t burn the band did much better work this is a curiosity piece more than having any intrinsic value label ok mat the cops thought it was funny but it turns out they already had one woud you happen to have a mat that says send bail bondsman label great film horrible dvd if you re looking for a bizarre violent psychedelic western with an amazing soundtrack then this movie is for you unfortunately this dvd version suffers from constant heavy compression artifacts or blocky pixelization that is especially noticeable in the bright out of focus shots and darker scenes not dissimilar to bargain-bin dollar dvd s this is one of the most disappointing dvd s in recent memory especially with a price tag that should be avoided unless you have absolutely no other way to see the film label the book is a confused intoduction to the kabbalah chic cicero has produced a book that is simply a regurgitation of material that can easily be found in the works of isreal regardie the basic premise of the book is that the kabbalah can best be grasped as a physical reality by walking through the tree the book lacks any focus on what the tree of life is in spiritual terms and instead is a compilation of correspondences from crowley s from a pragmatic piont of view the exercise of walking the tree simply cannot be done in a normal sized room label not as promising as it seems i picked up this book on a whim and i just could not make it through half of the book i was dissappointed and now think twice before buying this author again label more like and it was terrific it was so much better than i dared hope for it had it all i absolutely loved it until almost the end when lazar pushed allegra away because he was afraid for her it s not that this bothered me since so many romance novels seem to do this it was how viciously he did this it was almost perfect label could not finish it this book did not work for me it is pretty sensual but still i could not get into it just a typical subpar romance that does not have any special quality to it they have sex too late in the book and after that i really didn t care i like books that can interest me even after the h h have sex the first time this book feels like it dragged on about the first sex because it does not have a lot to offer label a book to be taken little by little rogues and vagabonds takes place over quite sometime and has some flash backs the book is so well written that it is easy to follow i m taking my time reading to really reflect on the characters because as it says on the back of the book it s such a conundrum to figure them out as they change so much over time i haven t even finnished and already three other people are in line to read it it s great for anyone in the arts business or anyone even thinking of becoming an actor it paints a picture of what actors go through the ups and downs i love this book and recomend it to everyone label warning inferior build quality i had a pair years ago sounded great and built like a tank with birch plywood just got a pair and they are half the speaker they used to be i e they still sound great but they are built like crap using mdf and glue guns save your money and buy a speaker from a company that cares about build quality as much as they do sound also dont buy the excuses that they use high quality mdf and it has tighter tolerances better resins blah-blah crap material is crap material label terrible bra one of the worst bra i ve ever purchased ordered my normal size and the fit was terrible unfortunately i m stuck with it and it can t be returned label breezies applique bra great seller and price very comfortable bra and gives nice shape to your bustline under clothes label very soft i am very difficult to fit the material used in this bra is very soft however the fit is not very comfortable it is probably just me i would say the product is great label wanderlost a lot of books seem to be taking the approach this one does in terms of writing completing the whole story in the form of e-mail correspondence between the main characters while it was a novel approach at first it has started to wear thin and i kind of wish writers wouldn t use it so frequently in nay case this book lacks character depth because of how it is formatted emails only and it s hard to follow the thread of the story sometimes because of it the central plot was a romance a triangle romance where the heroine is caught between lovers it wasn t a really good book and i wouldn t recommend it the characters were not very interesting and the exploits of the main character were not as adventurous as the title and preview made it seem i think the story would have actually worked much better if it had written in a traditional format label dont order from worldofbookusa it has been a month since i ordered this book from worldofbookusa and i still have not received it i m sure the book is great but the supplier is not label haunted a boring and uninteresting book i managed to plow through to page then just could not take any more possibly without the teenage daughter it might have had a chance if there was a zero on rating it would have got my vote label big letdown like several other people have commented i purchased this book based on the excellent reviews it is a decent story at best several things need to be said it is not by any stretch of the imagination scary there are several creepy sequences but that is it not horror second the book does essentially nothing a very slow boring tedious and pointless build until the last pages out of is ridiculous it really isn t building much it could have been said easily in pages vs all-in-all i would chalk this up to a bunch of people reviewing being a little downsy as well as ridiculous anyone that says this is scary or terrifying shouldn t read horror novels whatsoever i ve read my share of horror fiction and this is easily the worst and least scary label disappointed i have to admit that i was very disappointed with the novel after reading the glowing reviews this book was probably one of two books i have never finished i just could not bring myself to complete it i honestly found no character that pulled me in emotionally everyone seemed to be caricatures of one fault or another including the father and daughter in all honesty my opinion of almost every book or movie rests with the abilty to care about at least one character in this book i found no one i was turned off by every person in the story and as for the chills i did not see what the other reviewers saw i have never been one to put someone off of something but this time i just had to write something down judging by all of the other reviews i am in the extreme minority i may give another of tamara thorne s novels a try it may have just been this particular book label false advertising terrible first of all what is pictured appears to be all copper wire what i got with my purchase was one side copper and one side silver colored wire second-this is not gauge wire-it is smaller than gaugethird problem-spool is advertised as feet my spool contained feet it appears from other reviews of speaker wire from this same manufacturer distributor that they are systematically shorting each spool this is not a time mistake cannot recommend this product label mothers powerball mini the mothers powerball mini is a great product for polishing the aluminum parts on my bike but i found that it was almost as easy to do it by hand with a rag this gave me just as good if not better results than the powerball also the powerball tears very easily especially in tight areas where it can catch on areas of the bike which is the reason for the star rating label a wiersbe classic that all should read christianity is a relationship between god and each believer with jesus being the mediator first timothy that relationship sometimes breaks down because we frail humans always want to take the easy way out the easy way out is to make rules about how we should live such as never drink alcohol and never go to movies wiersbe explains why rules like those are detrimental to a believer s growth he explains in simple but precise ways that the law of moses was intended to cause each of us to realize two things we cannot please god by following the law because we can t follow the law and the law was designed to teach us that we need a savior from the law that savior is none other than jesus the mediator between a holy god and unholy mankind wiersbe s book is simply a great book read it and be free label time consuming projects i love volume of this series it has simple easy to create products this volume contains much more time intensive projects even my avid scrapbook buddies agree that this book is definately not as good as the first one label disappointed also bought these slippers a couple of days ago and the sole is falling apart bit by bit from where its attached to the upper do not buy label following the endless road so i would never normally pick up a cd like this but one has to admit that when someone comes out with a pedigree of music like tuff jeff one perks up and listens the guy has played with some of the ramones and even worked with david bowie you know so i can say i was honestly impressed the cd s got that old school rock and roll feel that everyone can appreciate it s definitly worth listening to label historical romance a gentle giving i just finished a gentle giving by dorothy garlock and it was wonderful this one was not one of my favorites of hers but it was very good willa actually escaped a house in flames caused by the angry townsfolk in nothing more than ther nightgown the family she joins up with lends her clothing so not even owning the clothing on her body she is thrust into the hard life of a wagon trail when the father is killed leaving behind two teenagers to fend for themselves willa chooses to help them get to their next of kin in the big horn mountains this was an excellent read and i m off to read the listening sky by dorothy garlock now label cheap mouse left and right click buttons are not very responsive sometimes you do not know if you clicked or not other than that it works label this is a fun game this game is kinda fun i wouldn t say it is the best game ever but it is still fun label action packed but hard to enjoy it is the newest thing for hollywood directors to give you the moving camera action shot to my knowledge the new james bond series does it most and best however there have been tons of other films that have attempted to emulate this technique and have failed sadly rounds is one of them the moving camera is supposed to give the viewer the feeling of being in the action or an actual by stander to it and does work sometimes the problem with rounds is that there is barely a steady shot in the whole film this film seems like it was directed by a first time director with no real concept of filming a movie instead of feeling like you are at the scene of the action the busy camera is distracting and diminishes from what might have been a better film in the hands of a more competent director and mr cena doesn t help he s not the greatest lead and needs better support in front of and behind the camera if he is going to shine label not worth buying at all unfortunately there is no much details inside it is not saying or showing how to exercise for the whole body all what he is doing is posing in front of mirrors i got no benefit from buying it i do not recommend any one to buy it thanks label guitar album delux i bought this item because of jackie king a guitarist of some interest although king s solo career is spotty his work under the influence and structure of willie nelson is king s best king is given free reign in this session and runs the gamut from frantic to west coast western swing the tracks without nelson are showcases for king but it is nelson who brings variety and grounding to the session he also solos on these cuts at length on my window faces south and does some fine playing in a jazz vein if you like this i would also recommend the earlier collaboration angel eyes label surprisingly moving although a documentary it was a surprisingly moving and warm film the main character the faithful monk tenzin is very likable and your heart goes out to him when he expresses doubt that he is up to the task of finding his teacher s new incarnation there is a scene where he revisits his late teacher s now-abandoned and ruined retreat home and he is overwhelmed with sorrow and begins to cry depictions like that abound in this film moments of touching human-ness that make you realize that people are the same all over the world there are also moments of joy like the scene where tenzin and his reincarnated master now a very young boy are both trying as fast as they can to make bottles of soda pop foam up and spill out over the glass this is not a story about buddhism as much as it is a story about love label sunset war st infantry div a gift for my father he was in the st during wwii he enjoyed it thoroughly label mind expansion this book really puts the world into perspective at least it did for me readers would be hard-pressed not to walk away from it with some sort of brain change or alteration to their reality tunnel the exercises are nice because it puts the content of the pages into an empirically tangible medium and yes you will spot a few quarters hahaha although it was written late in wilson s career i think it is a good book of his to start with because it isn t too jargon-laden i also recommend the cosmic trigger series label my last koontz book for a while i have found koontz to be a masterful storyteller in all of the books that i have read by him phantoms watchers from the corner of his eye intensity but this book was horribly and unnecessarily wordy and cumbersome the desriptions of everything from the lawn to the moonight were ridculously lengthy and the dialogue throughout was unrealistic and misguided pray that this book comes out as a movie b c it will take you much longer than two hours to needle through wanna read a wonderful book try the weight of water by anita shreve it s wonderful label great reading this is a great mix of scenes all convulging on the same story the characters are so well-written that as the story unfolds you cry with them laugh with them are driven to experience all of their emotions amazements and frustrations as if you were with them all the time very excellent reading label slow and tedious i have always enjoyed koontz and his books but this is too long and wordy in paperback it was pages it could have been done under it is a rambling and tedious book to read while i felt i should put it down i skimmed it and still got the story i am one who could have easily put it down at any time i guess a great author gets his name and then can write anything and it will be a best seller label one door away from heaven i have read many many koontz books can t ever put them down however this one is not very well written it is extremely choppy bouncing back and forth with no real story plot i am way through has taken over months and there still is no rhyme or reason to this book if you love koontz i think you ll be disappointed i was my husband is almost done with the book and says it doesn t get any better label excellent odyssey through the human experience while this wasn t as suspenseful as intensity which i believe is koontz s best work this is an excellent story with very vivid characters particularly that of leilani a handicapped girl this story reminds us of what is truly important in this life and to not identify people by their limitations it s laugh out loud funny at times and definitely keeps you turning the pages he really gives you an insight into the daily lives and tribulations of ordinary people you might otherwise ignore and depicts them in bizarre circumstances at times that give them an opportunity to show their inner strength in a truly memorable way it s a book that will make you think and will entertain you in the process a great summer read lynne loganauthor of the crime chronicles of decker zane label one door away from boredom i have read most if not all of dean koontz s novels and have loved just about every one of them however i found this one the most boring of all and couldn t wait until the end i usually can read his novels in a short amount of time but this one i found hard to pick up night after night nice try can t wait for his next one hope it s better than this label ugh a labor to read and i m a koontz fan the book jumps chapter to chapter slowly describing the characters and does little to tie them together i usually read koontz s books so rapidly that i m disappointed when they re over this book has been a trudgingly slow and boorish read in comparison to ticktock or watchers or a host of others this one is a real sleeper sometimes i scan a chapter and see nothing then go back to read it in detail and find the same what a disappointment pick another one of koontz s books not this one label one door away from unbelievable i love mr koontz and have long read his novels watchers intensity odd thomas and so on but this was dissappointing not to mention just plain depressing and come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters okay okay we know the year old leilani has a high iq but really she speaks like a year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence these characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into therefore i put it down after pages of this twattle koontz has done much better in the past lastly let s keep dogs out of your next few novels please it s getting a bit old how about a smart cat or raven for your next novel maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do label early disapointment i never read anything by koontz and apparently this was a bad choice to be my first i read only a part of kindle sample and simply could not continue mr koontz one does not describe a precocious year old by describing an adult then declaring her a superintelligent child sigh another bestselling author on my don t touch with a ten foot pole list label worst porduct i ve ever tried i just received this item today and headed straight to the tanning salon after work i rubbed it all over my face and body before i realized that my whole face was on fire i looked in the mirror and realized my whole body was red i then ran to the bathroom and washed my face i then threw on my cloths and ran home to shower this stuff off and cover myself in benadryl i have never had an allergic reaction like this in my life i never even got in the tanner it was all from this lotion i have been using another satori sol product at the salon and loved it the one with cooling this one has tingle which i am apparently alleric too try a small packett or don t before you buy a whole bottle of this label music for the bagpipe but not by the bagpipe very disappointing for those who love to hear the great highland pipe most of the songs have too many instruments to count and if the pipes are playing you can t hear them clearly if you are wanting to hear bagpipe music played on the ghp look elsewhere label the worst i got this to replace the kitchen clock we had by our pool which despite getting rained on worked for two-plus years we had just redone our yard and i decided to splurge on something nice it was outdoor and copper so i justified the outrageous price first of all the face was copper not white as shown which made it hard to see the time from a distance this was not a problem however because it stopped keeping the correct time after a couple of weeks it never stopped completely but the time would vary from to hours off everyday it was almost a joke to see what time broke ben would say when we went out if it had been my walmart special this all would be funnier i m glad to see this item is currently unavailable i wish it would have been before i got suckered label fits easy install this fit my saturn sl1 was easy to install and looks and operates just like the original label not good at all the only good thing about this phone case is that has a little weather protection and in some situations protects the phone from shocks drops and that obviously looks cool the swivel adaptor collapses after months of usage so it makes the release button useless the phone case will release itself with just a little pressure in the bottom even if you don t push the release button the case will fall if you are getting out in of your car think twice before you buy it label squirmy wormy is tops peacock studios has released an absolutely delightful album that will appeal to children of all ages and adults too these songs will stay with you your whole life if i could give squirmy wormy a star rating i would label low budget but worth every penny van damme portrays a streetfighter who gets caught up in the middle of a raw fighting hard hitting circuit he keeps fighting to raise money for his brothers family who needs the money or they ll become homeless the storyline is cheap and the flick itself is low budget but the fight scenes are supurb and the acting on van dammes part is excellent in my opinion of course this movie is the greatest low budget action film available on the market today if you like martial-arts films instead of explosions and basic killing spree action films than lionheart is your ticket to everything you want to see enjoy label great for carpal tunnel syndrome these gloves were recommended to me by a physical therapist who treated me for carpal tunnel syndrome and they are wonderful the splint on top provides support but is flexible enough to allow a good range of motion the beads on the bottom cushion the wrist and keep the hand in a good position while typing i wear these gloves day and night and i am able to do almost everything with them on write use the computer do housework etc label very fun but i probably should have gotten something a little more traditional while i m still learning this music is fun and wonderful but has a lot of opportunities for a little bit of theatrical movement and as a beginner i can barely get the basics down right now but a wonderful add to any collection i m still listening to it even if i don t know what i m doing label part drops june for all thoes who loves ms clarks books as much as i do make sure to get part too this one which was off the chain go check ouy her myspace or website to see for your self label defective standard av cables worked fine and very convenient my fiber optic audio out did not work however which was one of the main reasons for the purchase no info on manufacturers website about problems tried calling the support line and it just tells me the voicemail is full no response from their tech support through email after days of waiting just returning the item for a refund companies like this don t deserve my business everything with amazon however was good as always label so glad to find one of my favorite exercise videos from the s back again and now on dvd great fat burning video that is joint friendly and is a good workout happy to find this one again and now on dvd label much safer than plastic i am slowly changing all my food storage containers over to glass instead of plastic glass is much safer to store your food in especially when heating food this was a great value and over all i am pleased with the set a couple of the bowls have a slight odd shape to them which can make it tricky to get the lids on label good idea but needs help we bought these bowls about months ago from amazon i was thrilled to have glass storage for reheating however as others have complained the bowls have straight sides so they don t nest well they are now chipping on the edges and we ve had to throw several out it s past the amazon return period the other problem is that the box came with one less lid than needed find a better set this one just has too many problems label does the job i wanted to get away from plastic storage containers and bpa and so on these fit the bill and the fact that you can reheat leftovers in the heavy duty glass containers is a big plus rubberized tops could be better designed but are really serviceable label happy with pyrex i love pyrex everything we are trying to get away from the use of so much plastic and disposables so i purchased this set for home storage and for carrying our lunch to work these are great the lids seal tightly and we ve had no leaks i would advise against stacking these together though i did have two get stuck and one of them chipped slightly getting them apart i store them with the lids on to prevent this from happening again i also love that these are american made i will be purchasing more sets of these label great quality i love these nice sizes wish at least a few were rectangular don t like that lids are a part of the piece count i don t dish wash hand wash only scared of chipping after reading the other reviews if you take care of them they should last label if some lids are missing amazon will not handle the problem but rather tell you to contact the manufacturer of this product i received this product with several missing lids label good product value for money i was skeptical of getting glass ware for daily use but decided to try after reading the reviews i also wanted to move away from plastic containers the pyrex set is really practical and i find it a staple in the kitchen now the value for money is great and i ended buying an additional set as well label great buy was everything i hoped it would be at a great price pyrex is a great brand and very durable would recommend to anyone looking for long lasting storage sets label great i was looking for some non-plastic containers to put leftovers in and these did the trick it does come with a lot more smaller pieces than i ll probably ever use but i liked the size of the bigger ones they put in so i m very happy with it label works well i like leftovers these work great they have a couple that are the perfect size for a leftover lunch as well as some bigger options that will hold a cut-up personal size watermelon one flaw they do not hold liquid well they will leak if turned on their side label satisfactory purchase the item was as pictured and delivered in a reasonable amount of time i like purchasing from amazon find them reliable and easy to deal with label coolpix camera case the camera case work very good with my nikon coolpix l1 camera if you carry no extra batteries if you carry extra batteries and an extra scancard it becomes very difficult getting the camera in and out of the case label perfect for nikon coolpix p2 i read the reviews and felt comfortable enough to get one for my p2 it s prefect for my p2 like some of the reviews the interior pocket is pretty much useless if you want it to store an extra battery you can probably slip an extra memory card in the interior pocket the exterior pocket is big enough for extra batteries and a couple of memory cards there is a feature that i didn t see anyone mentioned is that if you don t want to bother with the shoulder strap you can this case on your belt label elegant and masculine very nice knife i am extremely impressed with the qc of buck i have a bald spot on my forearm that is a testament to how sharp it is out of the box i look forward to acquiring more buck knives in the future label wish it had a skirt on underneath the face is times better than the original gabby figure but too bad this one doesnt have her full costume if u take off the dress shes wearing her top and panties no skirt i wish the skirt on the other figure could come off so i could put it on this one label headers picture of hedman headers shows long-tube headers they are actually shorty headers picture s should represent actual product i had to send my order back and reorder label bucks for a kb pdf file yeah it mentions this is an ebook not an interactive cd please know what you are ordering in a separate product description but what it doesn t say is that it s a tiny pdf file that ships on a disk in a paper sleeve protected by a standard envelope with a cent stamp on the front and they charge you for shipping oh and if you want they ll offer you the opportunity to just email the pdf file to you for the same price and still charge you the shipping apparently amazon won t let them email it to you without a shipping markup according to them label very powerful little tool excellent product-delivers the froth is seconds it was a great gift they love it label excellent but be careful works very well just be careful not to bend stem at all if you do bend it say by running with frother touching side or bottom of cup glass you will likely never get it back to true no matter what you do it will probably continue to work but not nearly as well we bought a second and are treating it with kid gloves label doesn t work get yourself a real milk-frother and save the time and money no matter what kind of milk you use or what its temperature is this tool will not make stiff cappuccino foam looks cool but waste of money label th in the series heretics of dune is the th title in the dune series and takes place several thousand years after the events of god emperor of dune it takes as its protagonists several members of the bene gesserit as they confront the bene tleilax and the honored matres a religous order from the scattering that took place after the death of leto ii herbert s writing continues to improve and this is the most accessible book yet in the series although it still not an easy read label fantastic lens i have had this lens a short time now and the weather has not permitted much in the way of outdoor use the shots that i have been able to take including some indoor available light and flash have been superb extremely sharp optics with excellent fov this lens will probably stay on my l1 body for all-around use label oh boy let me be the first to say that this is just beautiful oh what a dark creepy and wonderful recoridng wow it s hard to pick a favorite cut on this one if you re like me and you love movie themes covered by talented musicaians then you ll love this hail satan label great book tells the story of the uprising and the massacre along with color and black white photographs this book did a great job of explaining the events that took place in an easy to understand fashion label do not buy zero stars long story short bought for daughter for christmas it is in the trash this was the worst toy doll purchase ever label an outstanding ranchera aritist i purchased nydia s first solo cd when it came out and have been amazed with her talent since she not only has endless natural talent she is a student of her art nydia s obvious love of singing is prevelant in her music i took my grandmother and my aunt to see her in concert and they were overwhelmed my mother has compared her on more than one ocassion to the fabulous and in our opinion the true queen of ranchera amalia mendoza amalia never got the attention she deserved but i sure hope nydia does i can only compare her to amalia and maria de lourdes if you are a fan of ranchera and mariachi you will understand what i mean when i say that nydia cries when singing i love her current album but i hope that she will make an album of old mexican standards such as the one luis miguel did it would truly bring nydia the attention and respect she deserves if you ever have the chance go see her in concert we love her in tucson arizona label i found this book to be very helpful i agree with many reviewers that say why would you want to however i found this book to be very helpful because i have been able to identify several toxically self-absorbed people in my life even in very spiritual circles and now i can see them in a more realistic way karen anderson label a great intro to golf for those who are just learning while michelle mcgann comes across well in this publication much of the credit should go to her ghost writer who seems to have done an excellent job in translating a pro s techniques into layman s terms this is a good book which is a valuable learning tool for those who are just being introduced to the sport subjects are discussed in a very simple concise way and at no times does the author speak to the reader in a condescending way a great read label unforgettable story i read an article in the ladies home journal and wanted to read more about this amazing woman i bought the book and my mother and i have both just finished reading it what an unforgettable story and what a strong and courageous woman is sala thank you ann for bringing this to the rest of the world and for all the incredible extra research you have done to fill in the spaces it is the story of a life that is much too important to be kept in a box my husband will read this beautifully and lovingly written book next and i have recommended it to my book club thank you thank you label a great read a great read if you are interested in the inside story of the war in the pacific it has a lot of relevancy to label compelling since i watch a lot of history channel and war history evan thomas and his book sea of thunder has put faces on the sailors there victories and defeats both mential and physical errors abound yet understanding the condictions of war at the time makes them less important than the bravery shown by both sides once started it is hard to put the book down now i m going to look for evan thomas book john paul jones label interesting i believe there are certain topics that you need to discuss with a potential mate significant other and this book seems to be the middle ground between where you are now and where you will be later on a promising informational book label a great staple classic now available online everything is good about this product its vendor on amazon as described packed well fresh arrived quickly i will definitely repeat this purchase label problematic install and wants to reinstall i have used older paint shop pro versions for years without issue but this version has serious installation problems in that is constantly tries to reinstall itself after hunting for security products on my computer that would have modifiend the files to make it think it needs to be installed again i found none tech support was useless the usual reponses are you logged on as and administrator etc as they didn t really read my email about the problem and just sent cut-and-paste responses to general computer problems then the tech support people got rude and told me to figure out the problem yourself there is a reason why this software is almost free label just forget this software software is ok but don t believe in the rebates it has been over months now and calls to their company and they have promised me over and over again that they had an overwhelming response and that it will come in weeks now months after sending the rebate in the status shows as processing on their web site poor company unethical way of treating their customers label outdated and now just one of many overpriced options this book was never unique and is now outdated why purchase this book when the information contains is now available in many free and more user-friendly formats the author was merely re-packaging information that has been around all along but now she wants you to pay her for it label what a great book this book is amazingly helpful i was a new owner of a mexican redknee and had no clue how to handle her she was so sweet but i was just too afraid to handle her then i found this book princess now has brothers and sister paris ricky and jake they are very sweet animals and the breeding part was helpful as i am getting prepared for my spiderlings d label great picture lousy service the monitor has a beautiful crisp image perfect for my work cad development web surfing it also has a neat feature it will accept dvi inputs from computers and then allows you to toggle between computers with a button on the front panel sadly this feature stopped working after roughly months of use when i called hp to claim a warranty repair i was transferred to a service agent in another country after minutes of repeating and correcting serial numbers model numbers i was told that this monitor was not in their database and therefore i could not be helped what the heck i offered to email pictures of the model number sticker fax copies of the invoice etc all to no avail the service representative declined my request to speak with a manager to resolve the issue so i guess i m just stuck with a half-broken product in the end it s still a nice monitor but i m frustrated with the lack of customer service label an all time classic a wonderful collection of the original x-wing game with the two add on campaigns sure the graphics are old as are the sound effects and some of the missions are nigh on impossible but it is still hard to beat for the re-play value for any who enjoyed the original or would like to see where the more modern versions of the same game come from this is one to get label not your usual tough-guy cop story but a human one this story told in the first person is an imaginative and interesting look at what a new york city detective really is a human being with human frailties it is also a really good mystery i look forward to more from mr dee label easy to install slightly quieter than my old nutone fan this fan is actually cheaper than the previous nutone ceiling fan that i installed years ago in the kitchen above the stove installation is simple if you have easy access to the attic and possess some basic knowledge of electrical connections i expected it to be significantly quiter than the old nutone airplane propeller it is but only slightly still i recommend it the fan does the job and the price is right label seal between layers breaks too easily this is the rd of this type of travel press i have had and all of them seem to have this problem i ve only had the latest one for less than a month and now the seal is broken again i m really quite disappointed i expected more from bodum label niece loved it her father didn t i sa i saw an ad for this product in a magazine ordered it here and had it shipped prime to my niece for her th birthday it arrived promptly and she loved it she immediately sat down and sculptured some things later i heard from my sister that although she could cope with the mess as bad a playdough apparently her husband could not and had sent a message saying if i ever sent any of his kids this stuff again he would fly here and feed it to me lol it must really be a great toy for a child label the kids love this this toy is incredible and durable hours of play exceptional for airplane rides amazing how well it keeps the attention of the kids and adults label metal connector nails unavailable in i was going to buy this for a deck job the bostitch joist hangar nails are horribly overpriced on amazon and not available locally my local guy told me bostitch is no longer supplying the metal connector nails he just shrugged when i asked about the future availability of the inch metal connector nails he said they might just be selling out what they had and there would be no more however that was just speculation as bostitch ain t talkin will search more first either that or buy a brand with reasonable nail prices i will have to do a nail count to see if the saving on nails will pay for buying a senco joistmaster label nailed it excellent nail gun easy to set the nail depth with this full head type nailer the nails come with more plastic connector material in between than clipped head nails the full head naila are good nails with no jams but sometimes the plastic connector debris needs to be picked away from under the set nailhead to produce a smooth finished surface label no comment i bought this thing thinking it would be something special it s pretty cool it fits the computer nicely doesn t scratch etc however it s made pretty cheaply and made in china the stitch on the inside doesn t appear to be sown all that well however for it does a great job of giving my mac book pro a nice smooth small and durable case label no gimmicks simply a great high quality knife no tricky lock features or tactical blade styling just and excellent all-around folding knife good quality steel super grippy handles and a blade that opens so smoothly and quickly that there s no need for assisted opening you can t beat it for the price label what a piece of trash although described as a hardcover i purchased this for my daughter for her birthday and there was nothing in it that was not in the dragonolgy text it was also not a hardback but a little pamphlet in a box with a cheap bit of plastic token definetly not of the quality of dragonolgy label throw away after trying everything we could and spending an additional dollars for ink we will throw this new machine away i would give it to someone but i think it would be such a disservice that i would lose friends instead of helping hewlett packard used to make good printers this is the third and final junk printer and the worst even hewlett packard has perpetrated on us yet we have a new policy at our company if it says hewlett packard the answer is no label no more monthly fees please i am an old school d d fan and love online gaming i am sorry though for a game and then a monthly charge and a small lvl cap that people reached in mere days i don t care how much fun a game is lose the monthly fee there are tons of great free online games off soapbox now label dissapointment is an understatement i got this game as a birthday and was very excited to try it out needless to say i played the game for nearly a week before giving up completely the idea behind it is great an mmorpg that doesn t revolve around killing endless amounts of rats and pigs to level up it promoted party-based adventuring to the extreme the modules quests were self-contained everything seems just great but the execution for this game is extremely poor the quests just aren t much fun the combat system is ok the way leveling is done doesn t make much sense especially for a game based on d d i dunno i found this game extremely boring even for an mmorpg this game was my second time trying games in the mmorpg genre and it ll definitely be my last don t waste your money label poor quality control by lenox i have received two of these through amazon one as a replacement for the first and in both cases the center basket design is off-center i measured it they re clearly off-center amazon was wonderful in working out the return updated review i have since received one of these directly from lenox and it too has an off-center basket this is clearly a design flaw in the product label please bring back the old flavor please please please please please bring back the old spearmint altoids flavor they used to be my favorite type of altoids until this new great taste came and ruined them this new flavor is not sweet at all and just tastes all-around disgusting it s bitter and tastes like those foul cough drops that no matter how bad a cough i had i would never make myself take you took a wonderful thing and changed it for the worse much worse please revert back to the old recipe label why did they change a good thing i ve been buying the spearmint altoids for years and loved the product i just got a new tin of the new great taste which is horrible it tasted like menthol such a drag i see now that there are more artificial ingredients in it why i hope the company sees the feedback and reverts back to the original recipe or they ll lose a lot of customers they ve lost me for now label zzzzz the concept of bringing together smallpox and hiv in an historical crucible intrigued me and i thought i would find the story about using young boys to perpetuate the smallpox vaccine scientifically interesting the latter was true but the more i got into this book the more i actively disliked the main character alma a growing dislike of the character made it hard to plow through this long and overly detailed book the author in my opinion wasted my time on needless and seemingly endless details that added nothing to the story for me but pages time and effort though the book apparently appeals to some it was an experience in reading drudgery for me nuff said label complete drivel the author was more impressed with his being a team leader that doing justs to the historic peshtigo fire the mundane radio calls and flash backs didn t help his effort label does not keep mosquitos away i covered my son with this spray and he was in the woods for minutes and came out with new bites he is prone to mosquito bites but this did not work at all i don t think the amount of deet is strong enough compared to in deep woods label boring i thought this book started out interesting but it kept getting more and more dull i finished the book anyway because i thought it would get better towards the end but it didn t i don t recommend this one label the right tool for the job we needed a mm mono female rca male adaptor to connect to our phone system s music on hold rca input connector to connect this with our audio source we coupled this with a very reasonablecables unlimited aud mm male to male stereo cable feet black the price was right for the whole package this little piece of audio hardware was essential in making it work label doesn t work well to change my feelings from my experience these kind of healing books don t work well to change my feelings and attitudes they do have temporary effects but do not last long this book also was not the execption there are many things to do which i should do right now to change my life but i don t and can t do these things always when i read such kind of books i am firm about trying to do these things but i don t take a whim for reading these kind of books again and thus lose an opportunity to do good things entirely i think volunteering for building gesundheit institute in west virginia and meeting patch adams is much more effective than reading this book label abc fun my three year old loves this dvd after renting it from redbox about three different times i finally found it on amazon educational and fun highly recommend to any preschooler label great story and illustrations my children and i really like this book i appreciate the realistic situation in which the little boy is tempted to lie i think my children could really see something they relate to and they could see the moral of the story about how lies get out of hand great book label all of the sissi movies i saw all sissi s movies years ago i will like to have it in inglish or spanish on dvd is it possible or not label slow duration time ruins it all this is a good camera in terms of its functionsyes but this camera s achielles heel is that it takes too long to actually take any picturesthey turn out blurry because it doesn t take the picture when you hit the button it needs time to focus or just to respond to your touch it is even worse with flash the camera takes too long to come back after taking a flash photoso if you want a so-so camera that operates well you can get thisor you can get that anywhere it s all about what you need this camera for i want to take pictures that i can rely on to take when i hit the buttonit s not with d label a whole lotta huh this book is unique in that it is the first book that you need that you won t understand i was directed to purchase this book by a professor who was a student of layton i wanted to better understand the gnostic traditions and this book works to explain the gnostic mind in mind-numbing detail the western enlightenment conditioned mind will not easily understand these scriptures because they don t exist in the rubric of rationalism they are mythology the gnostic scriptures are more like reading hesiod s theogony or ovid s metamorphoses than the new testament if your goal is to truly understand gnosticism layton is indespensible however if all you want is a general understanding of gnostics avoid this book it will only muddy the water you have been warned label beautiful ordered this product about a year ago and i am disappointed i forgot to post a review this halo was perfect for my brother s wedding and matched the dress we ordered to the tee i couldn t be more pleased with this product label verbose and poorly written we used this book for our materials science class and while it contained a lot of information the information was very poorly presented the text would often refer to figures and tables nowhere in the vincinity and it was written in such a way that it was extremely difficult to follow they didn t emphasize the important parts so it was unclear what we should ve known label buy it what more do i have to say jim roberti the name should tell it all for those of you who know him well you know what im talking about for those who dont well let me explain real quick you name it jim a k a the man roberti can sing it all you name it he can sing it better thats right better jim im a big fan and love your music cant get enough keep the poconos happy with your awsome music your the best ill see u monday tuesday label fear-mongering and inaccuracy are the real agenda here i was unfortunate enough to come across this book at a local used book store and since it was dirt cheap i decided to read it because i was curious what i found was absolute drivel its anti-gay rhetoric is designed to reinforce negative attitudes toward homosexuals which it accomplishes vie generalizing stereotyping and the presentation of purely inaccurate information those who are already militantly anti-gay will find what they re looking for lies to back them up and those who are not will alternate between horror and laughter at what this book tries to do label scare them into heaven i have read many commentaries on homosexuals and the church this book dehumanizes the homosexual community it tells lies about the homosexual community and it keeps homophobia going this gives the people the right to go kill or threaten homosexual people if you read through church history and even read the bible for what it is there is nothing in there about homosexual acts i believe the best book out there that best tackles this topic called dirt greed and sex by william l countryman for those that read the book and stated that they are scared of what agenda the homosexual community has its beyond me people do not do enough research and or reading i read both sides then come up with my own decission i don t have someone else tell me what to believe i search it out label i d give this book negative stars if i could newflash homophobes of the world you guys are stupid it s doesn t take a big novel full of junk and conspiracy to tell the rest of the world that you have the iq of a tree stump please no more silly books pretending there is some kind of big issue please no sequel go sit in your corners and pity yourselves for being so close minded nobody should read this book for the sake of keeping their brain cells label embarressed christian i am so tired of anit-christians embarressing and saddening the rest of us by their egregious sinful hatred every point in this book revels the author to be just another of those self-rightious ignorant scared people who have no understanding of the love of jesus christ yet want to validate their fear and stupidity by saying and doing the most horrible things in the name of god please do the rest of us a favor hate in your our space and please actually read the first four books of the new testament jesus christ preached against judging others summing up the whole thing by relating the golden rule it s right there in the new testament in case you have no idea about what i am referring label factual inaccuracies i was disappointed that the authors of the book did not take a more balanced viewpoint for instance no mention is given of the fact that a homosexual co-founded the modern conservative movement along with william buckley or converted the civil rights movement to non-violencebayard rustin and organized the famous march on washington where martin luther king gave his famous i have a dream speech the authors seemed to come to the topic with their conclusion in hand and sensationalized some fairly boring situations to make their point there are better books on this topic label typical alarmist drivel the authors claims are unsubstantiated with flawed reasoning and research they are deliberately negative so as to further their own agenda of hate and intolerance it is one thing to believe your god says it is wrong it is another to deliberately and maliciously twist the facts of something so it fits what you want to believe the former is merely a difference of opinion the latter is downright dishonest the glbt only want the same rights accorded everyone else no more no less label paranoid psycho babble reading this book made me wonder my mothers old addage of a bunch of folk who don t have nothing better to do than cause trouble don t they have a job yeah writing this sick paranoid thesis on hatred this whole us verses them thing has to stop in this country usa or our freedom is at an end if you don t want to be homosexual then don t be but playing politics as suggested is a terrifing exercise in fascism in about years all of this version of freedom of speach will come to an end yes no more focus on the family no more kkk no more fox news just like spam is about to be outlawed so is the paraniod ramblings of talk radio bending logic and science to suit you doesn t make a country progress it makes it fall on its tail i could come up with a dozen reasons why homosexuality is wrong and still have no right to feel the need to down someone over their sexual impulses label all these years and still not a weak track usually after an artist has been out for a few years they start getting nice and their songs are not as good not bone thugs-n-harmony though they re still just as good as when they came out flow motion bump in the trunk wind blow i tried lil love i don t usually like bow wow but this song was pretty good jermaine dupri just needs to shut the hell up c-town alrightorder my steps alrightstreets mm one of my favorite songs on this whole albumgun blast another good onecandy paint so good so right sounds the same never forget me buy it label its about time for this change i admit it i ve been a fan of bone since the faces of death days truthfully probably their biggest fan but in all honesty bone has disappointed me a few times its not their last few cds wasn t good its just that i know as well as all of you know that bone can rip some trax when they want to this cd i hpe and pray is a sign of their future cds because this cd is the first in a looooong time that i see them live up to their potential they rip damn near every track almost as good as east this cd in my opinion is a great investment and a must have for every bone fan or anyone who like fast tongue twistin rap i give bone nothing but love for this cd and pray that their next one is even just half as good its great but its no east label my boyz are back i love this album been a fan since creepin on ah come up and i have been very critical of them on their past couple of albums this one reminds me of the old bone thugs but with a more updated sound i love it and any one who hasn t heard them entire album needs to go pick it up soon love my boyz label awful i enjoy the game of golf as much as anyone i enjoy great golf architecture and i enjoy well written novels mr shackelford may enjoy golf and may appreciate good golf arcitecture but he should leave novel writing to creative writers he is not a bad writer but fiction is not his fortay don t waste your time reading this one label zareba k9 electric fence charger don t buy this unit very disappointingzareba k9 fence controller for zareba pet and garden kit just doesn t work and after several calls to the manufacturer s tech support group who are pleasant and helpful they said to return it but from the techie s comments it sounds like they get a lot of complaints about the k9 unit and no it wasn t my wiring since my gauge galvanized wired fence line with porcelain insulators activated just fine as soon as i connected it to a havahart charger ss which unlike the k9 has a conventional ground terminal label not as good as i thought my daughter wanted a caterpilliar and i bought this for her but this worm is not fluffy you can get a better toy in a local store with this price label thanks amazon i really like using thebrother black toner cartridge tn in my printer i know what to expect and the quality is certifiable not so with the re-fills plus there s seldom anyone to stand behind the re-filled product but i hate the ordering process creating an account with passwords entering your address or times it s a hassle amazon de-hassled the ordering system with one click plus i saved money and got the genuine cartridge thanks amazon label toner cartridge this toner cartridge for the brother hl comes close to the advertised number of copies is suppose to make and buying it through amazon with the free shipping beats every price in my area label not brother i purchased brother toner i got a refurbished product with toner powder leaking out of the packaging on the positive side i decided to take a chance with it and so far it is working label not as good we bought this cartridge back in june and and it already dried out and is no longer functioning after a few hundred copies previous cartridges we purchased from office supply stores lasted for over a year and was good for a few thousand copies i would rather pay a few dollars more and get a longer lasting cartridge label a product of planned obsolescence i was one of the first to reveal that a bit of masking tape placed over the tiny window would extend the cartridge life by more than since that time i ve stumbled upon this very informative video the light bulb conspiracythe untold story of compulsory planned obsolescenceit appears i m not allowed to promote websites in these review i ve put enough to help anyone wanting to watch this you can figure out what s needed in order to watch this below pass it on label waste of money this book did not detail his famous shootouts it talked about him making up his own reloads and shooting people with them today you would get locked up by not using factory ammo the problem is in court they would say mr so and so could not use just factory ammo he had to make up his own killer bullets note this book is just old and out of date i do respect the author for the great job he had done the political side of he book is good but now its even worse label great to have works well as long as you can convince your family to use it the stainless steel makes it hard to see on black dishwashers in dimly lit kitchens but it s not too big of a problem label works great looked all over for a dishwasher magnet so i could stop putting post-it notes on the front of the machine when it hadn t been run yet this magnet is well made simple design looks great and it works was a little concerned after reading the reviews that the magnet might not be strong enough since my d w has the plastic panel on the front but it sticks and stays very well satisfied with this product label ok for the price these paper towels are definetly at the low end of the budget for paper towels are they worth the low price i paid for them yes i knew it was a risk purchasing them considering how low they were priced each individually wrapped package had several paper towels hanging out of it and when you open them to put them in the dispenser you end up having to remove the first paper towels to get to the ones that actually pull down nicely again given the price this is to be expected the paper towels themselves are fair to poor in absorbancy thus my lower rating you end up using twice as many to dry your hands as you would if you had purchased a higher quality paper towel this is a case of you get what you pay for if you are looking for budget paper towels and don t mind the above you will like these label best zorro ever i m yrs old and have been a zorro fan atic since age and a zorro video collector for years in my opinion this series is absolutely the best incarnation of zorro ever made and i have them all with a couple of hard-to-find old movie exceptions do not try to compare it to the disney series they re totally different styles both are great the disney series is pure walt disney style family fun this series has more meat to it much better character development less comedy but still quite a few comedic moments very family friendly but also excellent for adults label big bang theory the fifth season is hilarious and i really like to watch them in order i cannot wait to get the next season when it comes out on dvd label great stuff was still new as stated good condition plays perfect arrived early nothing but laughs for this product nothing but compliments from me label the best show ever this is a brilliantly written show and i would recommend this to every one its going to be a sad day when it goes off the air label gift my son loved this gift this is one of his favorite tv shows so it was a hit with him for sure label big bang fifth season i own the dvd sets for all five seasons this series continues to be somewhat entertaining but the humor continues to more and more for a junior high level audience as an older viewer i emjoy smart television and movies along with those containing a generous amount of slapstick comedy and as a computer and a v tech i can relate to people just like the characters in the show but i do not never have and never will find bathroom humor amusing in any form each and every show has at least one and usually more than one reference to bodily functions that i find unfunny and tedious wake up hollywood teenagers don t have money we do i would give this season two out of five stars label absolutely wonderful best season yet loved every minute of it all the characters have gotten more hilarious and sheldon is more priceless than before label always funny love every season and this is one of the best i can not get enough and can t wait to add season six label just as great as the rest my package came very quickly and was in perfect condition when i got it big bang is hilarious and i will be watching these episodes over and over again the ultraviolet digital copy is really weird because you cannot actually download the episodes and do what you want with them you download them to an ultraviolet client and watch them within the client label still great while the previous season was simply fantastic season is almost as good it does somewhat lack some of the more hysterical pieces in last season but overall it is the funniest show on tv or dvd at the moment label funny funny funny this season of episodes continues to provide the laugh out loud funniness that i found in the earlier years episodes label less than ok the show itself is wonderful and i have been watching it in order from start to finish my dvr didn t record this particular show and i could not figure out any other way to watch it right away so given all that i was on the desperate side the quality was not good i got the story line but the quality was jerky and fuzzy i hope i never need to watch any more episodes this way label great love this show it s also great that it includes blue-ray dvd and ultraviolet options the purchase arrived ahead of schedule and in great condition label super funny nice no commercials and best episodes we have been watching it during the holiday break as a family and enjoy label annoyed i wish i had read the review before buying this item as the playlist shown by amazon bears no resemblance to the real list of tracks in particular the one track i was desperate to get was i will by ruby winters was not on the actual cd i am really disappointed the only positive was that the cd was delivered within week and was in good condition label good theory vague and outdated code this book is a good start for those who want to work on the guts of their own mud the target audience seems to be accomplished c programmers the author assumes a great deal of expertise on the part of the reader i for one was left in the dark on many topics the code examples on the companion cd are not fully explained in the book and i found several code snippets in the source files that had no mention at all in the relevant chapters the code examples also will not compile on newer versions of gcc without a great deal of work this book is a good intro to network programming and does a good job of outlining what is needed to design and code a mud from scratch but i would stay away if you are not already an accomplished programmer label wonderful i really like how firm this brush is when handling the hair i am a hairdresser and i have been blowing out hair for years this is a great brush label camera power supply arrived on time for my presentation a must have for extended camera use a real battery saver label excellent book for elementary age children i am a school psychologist and mobile therapist and this book has come in handy on many occasions i work frequently with students who have been diagnosed with autism and i have found that this is one book that students really enjoy there are great pictures and stories that my students love to see and read we typically act the stories out afterward either in person or with dolls action figures no matter how resistant the students are to the rest of the activities they typically consider this a rewarding experience i would recommend it to all school staff and parents who deal with students that are lacking social skills in some way label the best book for teaching social skills and i ve used several i bought this book to help teach my year old with aspergers about how to deal with social situations the book uses real photos of children in various situations to teach the right way to do something like stand in line and also shows a photo with the wrong way it explicitly teaches among other things how to approach other children to play how to ask a teacher for help and how to have a conversation my son loves reading the book together and i can already see him implementing the lessons after just a few weeks for visual step-by-step learners this book is perfect i own at least books on teaching social skills and this is by far the best and most effective one i ve used label great compact pill case great if you have more than one or two pills to take every day i have to take meds in the pm as well so i have a green pill reminder for my evening meds these containers hold five plus pills depending on size plenty of room in each compartment hard to find this type of container at retail stores label best shape for me these sided pill keepers my family calls them pill wheels but you ll never find them that way on google are in my experience the best shape for this sort of thing round ones cannot be set up on their edge and the stick style with all the days in a horizontal row don t tuck as discreetly into a purse or pocket it s hard to find these in stores this is a great price and i ll order several note if you can t easily distinguish which are your morning pills and which are your evening you d best buy two of these and load them accordingly label works but nothing special i had a live and learn moment with this bottle cap opener i saw a similar one at a party and decided to purchase three for christmas presents i unfortunatley did not read reviews nor did i realize that this was coming from the uk nor did i realize that the shipping costs were astronomical almost more than the cost of the three openers my order was placed on december th and after three days i was notified that i would recieve them by january th obviously ridiculous and after an email to the seller through amazon i was told the openers were on their way and i did in fact recieve them after days i also expected the openers to look like the picture they did not it s a plain opener it does not say worlds greatest bottle opener it s plastic it works but it s nothing special disappointed for sure i m usually smarter about my purchases but have always had good luck with amazon and just let this one slip by so live and learn label joke at such a great price of course i bought two hoping i would make at least actualy hour uses out of it boy was i wrong the unit looks great and will hold a nice size camera weight wise issue is the hinges and other items fall apart worth and free shipping not worth a more than time use zero star label let down i was very excited to receive this tripod but was sad to find it arrive to me package fine with the top part broken off inside label not worth the mony what a pice of crab i know that is not the most expensive thing but really no way i m putting my camera on this toy i don t think that is a real stable tripod because there is a big chance that might fall of and break your camera label nice case but poor tripod the case is fine but the full sized tripod is flimsy i purchased three for a field project and one broke on first use super glue fixed it overall i am ok having made this purchase because the overall cost was reasonable if you want something that s rugged however i d stay away from this product label incredible layout i bought this book for my plant biology class even though i was required to only study about of it i read the entire thing from cover to cover if you want to find out about plants and the natural world take a course with this book or just buy it and read it like a good non-fiction book the layout and format are very modern and appealing there are sections on ecology which are very important in understanding what is happening to our environment right now plus the book doubles as a plant reference gardening book because it has a monster appendix with stats and care information on tons of common and rare plants you might grow at home wonderful book you won t be disappointed if you are curious about natural science label soon to be your litte ones favorite toy i can not say enough good things about this product our year old loves it well made colorful and packed with fun it is a fantastic product i highly recommend this toy i simply can not tell you how much your children will enjoy it purchase it and i guarentee it will soon be your litte ones favorite toy label the best naval flight recalections ever if u like anything with flying naval flying this book is the best it has all of his expereiences and makes u feel like u are really there i would recomend this book for anybody but if u would like to become a naval aviator like me then this book is especially for you the best book i have ever read admiral gillcrist thank you especially for writting about your career i plan on reading the other books by you i rate this a on a scale of label a book of great ideas this is a very pratical book in my opinion as one can creat ideas from the simplest thing label too too much i love old glamourous things pieces with history and beauty there are plenty of them in this book but as a decorating guide i found it a little too rich for my taste some rooms are over the top and some to me are hideous but taste is a very individual thing rachel ashwell s shabby chic books are more my style i think label very specific and lovely book i read this book a number of years ago and came across it again when researching a move into a small condo i agree that it is a wonderful book as the antithesis of potterybarn and restoration hardware living that is enough to kill anyone with an independant idea and while the author s style is too fussy for me i love the text and the pace of the book i would highly recommend it to someone who believes in interior decoration as a theory a passion if not a practicality label not what i expected this has been on my want list for a year or more and i finally found a copy at my library i am so glad i didn t buy this it is way way too overdone for my taste and in no way does it reflect any element of french style that i ve seen i d consider myself a francophile but even versailles looks restrained in comparison to strasser s layers upon layers upon layers i d hate to clean in any of these rooms there are some good ideas like the rinceau treatment of the warehouse room turned parlor but they were largely hidden under swaths of satin and clutter i d hoped for more depictions of true french designs label of no value this book has no interest for someone interested in decorating very boring not enough photos a real vanity book label great product this cream is nourishing and non-greasy love the feel on my skin no break outs and my skin absorbed it well would recommend this product highly i have very dry sensitive skin that s been resurfaced and it was very compatible with my skin label life imitates art this book isn t much more than a novelized screenplay kind of a cape fear in a political setting and i can t recommend it to anyone but for those questioning its credibility a state senate candidate in tennessee has just been charged with the murder of his opponent a heavily favored incumbent who was killed on his farm the parallels pretty much stop there but it s still eerie label good and bad great cd terrible dvd just buy the cd the dvd isn t worth using for a coaster i ve seen better video on cell phones oh yea the audio on the dvd is as bad as the video label only if you like disgusting things chew on this by eric schlosser and charles wilson is about fast food and how bad it is for you there are a lot of different stories in the book one was about schools taking out soda machines and putting in water and healthier drinks but still having mcdonald s and burger king which is even less healthy chew on this was not my favorite book i am a vegetarian so the meat part made me gag the book takes a long time to read it feels like forever the things that i don t like are when they explain how they kill a chicken and that pink lemonade is really made from bugs i know that the facts are disgusting but it is awesome how bugs can turn lemonade pink the purpose of writing the book is to convince the customers not to eat at fast food restaurants i suggest that you only read this book if you like reading about disgusting things adrienne f grade ms kawatachi label not as good as the rest this compilation while a decent collection of trance and techno failed to hit the spot unfortunately the quality seems to be deteriorating euphoria ii and iii were amazing collections if only they could come back with that same magic label inspiration to begin buying cds again seeing as my cd collection has all but turned into a glorified set of frisbees from the mc hammer craze i decided to start afresh with matt darey s euphoria level although i normally just download the most popular trance and house tunes on mp3 it s the lesser known tracks that fall inbetween that really stand out on a compilation like this the second cd is my favorite of the two i recommend tracks and all of which were discovered while napping on the train to work i also recommend darey s ibiza release within the euphoria collection at best you have a cd with mellow tunes to chill to and plenty of thumping sets to throw parties withat worst you ll find a few no-namer djs with good sound that might be worth checking out on mp3 label good compan this group got my order to me quickly and in one piece which is the only thing they needed to do i would buy from them a hundred more times label just want to help new mothers-like other reviews helped me i love it and so does my son i would def reccomend but if you have to bring it up a lot of stairs it is pretty heavy especially for the first coulple of month after baby when you are still weak if grandma is using it a lot it could be tough to heave into trunk of car label waste of money my son saw this advertised on tv and begged for it for christmas i looked for it everywhere and finally found one last one on the shelf right before christmas and thought it was a great score wrong after playing with it for minutes watching the alien balls fizzle like alka seltzers til they exposed a couple of cheap plastic toys he completely lost interest the van is poorly constructed and the parts do not fit back in nor does it stay together just try to store it on a shelf without it falling apart and spilling its contents everywhere this piece of junk is going right in the give-away bag and my son won t miss it label so not worth it this really ticked me off to find out that i only got one when it clearly says that it s sold as a six pack if it s possible i want my money back asap i don t understand why some people are receiving only one and then there are the lucky ones who get all six something tells me that those reviews are fake label not as advertised as with many other reviewers of this product i only got one canvas in the package not this company either can t count to six or it has the most expensive single canvas i have ever seen amazon s return process made it simple enough to get my money back but with all of the negative reviews of this product it is obvious that there is a serious problem with the way the product is described label i think it is safe to say that this is f2f s last album it s a shame now that they ve ruined their credibility i doubt that they will be able to make a new album under any label i can t help but think of the skit on big choice when they are talking to the record company exec the irony is delicious label six shooters and damsels in distress this is one of my favorite albums of all time and by far my favorite face to face album they sound completely different and pull it off nicely every song is great and sounds completely unique heart of hearts and maybe next time are two songs that when you fight with your woman and need to feel even worse about it you pop them bad boys in and you re good to go my favorite song on the album is protocol it kicks serious donkey i ve had this cd for close to years and it hasn t got old yet although it is hard to make out thru all of the scratches and battle scars and it has one of those f cking sun spots that looks like a kid stood over it with a magnifying glass and burned a hole thru it i need to get it again and again if need be and yes even again after it has been mangled or times i will still get it again well after two times i ll probably just steal it off of the internet thank god for piracy and plundering swashbucklers label new album not worth dancing to i have seen face to face more times than i can count and each time i loved them and they put on a great show i didn t think there was a face to face song that i didn t like and everyone was special in its own way when ever i felt down i would listen to them and it would pick me right back up and make me want to dance ignorance is bliss is just to slow i love the melodies but it sounds good with fast music the new album is just slow dramatic nothing like i expected i am just afraid to see them now because i won t be able to dance to the new stuff they need to go back to the don t turn away days and stay true to their fans istead of trying to reach the mainstream with their new album label a useful guide for all to love and serve gerald darring has compiled a helpful and thought provoking collection for preachers and every-day christians that make one to stop and think of the implications for living the the gospel in the concrete experience of life while broadening the reader s horizons for gospel living of today one of the best homily sources i have seen in my study and pastoral pratice it is a useful resource for prayer and reflection label wonderful tiles i gave my granddaughter this set just before her third birthday and she loved it she played with it non-stop all afternoon and the morning of her party a time when we thought she would be running around burning off steam instead it held her attention kept her focused and interested of course someone had to be there to help out three is a bit young to build complicated things but she was able to do quite a lot on her own with just a little help from an adult i recommend this highly label fantastic toy for all ages my husband wanted this toy for our daughter at her one-year birthday i thought she was too young but he was right these are great for even the smallest hands they are so easy to stick together and big enough she could still grab them now at yrs we got this dx set with the car and other cool pieces and it s even more fun to build things we ve built castles for her dolls tracks for cars and trains houses etc plus we have her sort them by color shape it can be educational as well as imaginative highly recommended as an added bonus parents have lots of fun with them too ps our children s museum has these as well and i have seen the colors worn off their pieces so i suppose after a lot of use the might show some wear but they still work great so who cares label they call me naughty lola they call me naughty lola personal ads from the london review of books edited by david rose they call me naughty lola was recommended to me by a friend and i normally enjoy british humor so i thought i d like it but something about the book was off for me it just wasn t that funny the book is nicely put together with some footnotes for references to british pop culture but there were some missing references the acronym wtlm is used in almost every ad but is never explained the ads themselves are creative but i wouldn t consider most of them humorous i think this book is best in short doses if you sat down and tried to read it straight through as i did the humor dies almost entirely label very good lens i had minolta maxxum st si camera and this lens is a perfect match for that silver color camera label buyer beware this is a cheap unreliable unit this fax worked okay for a few months then stopped being able to connect to any efax number always reports a poor line condition error yet i could turn around and fax the same doc on the same line to a regular fax machine number a minute later seems like this cheap fax machine cant connect to all types of faxes this unit is also making strange creaking noises now when trying to scan in a doc it s a cheap unit so buyer beware you get what you pay for i am now ordering a new fax machine to replace this one and this time i am spending a little more money to get a better unit bottom line buy something else label you ll like it this item does everything is is supposed to do it s the perfect home in copy quality is good label o k for a once in a while fax from home when i needed a fax machine i just went to amazon i ought to have checked the local office supply stores they had lower prices on this item it s o k for the situation where a fax is needed certainly not for a high volume of work label it gets jammed after month use i use this for home i don t use much fax usually once or twice a week for my sales application i need to fax in to sign up my clients i bought this because of its price and size but week after week it starts to jamming up which not only it slows my workflow and frustrating it began to rip my papers or wrinkles them up do not buy this unit it s total crap and worthless i learned my lesson and will invest more money to buy a reliable fax machine label very dissapoinyed by brother products my last brother fax a higher end model just stopped working can t find anyonme to work on these so you throw it away and buy a new one i thought i would stay simple and bought a but it jams continually and my biggest problem is only out of faxes sent goes through it keeps disconnecting my phone company says they have compatability problems with brother verizon so i am returning this for a higher end model again i guess you get what you pay for don t buy this or any brother product label stand by we purchased this as kind of a back up for when and if we need a fax not used often but to date it has worked fine have been pleased with all purchases from amazon hope the service continues label for home offices perfect finding this fax phone for under made it a must have it s easy to set up has all the features i need and more for home convenience it s small lightweight without being flimsy and for the dozen or so times i ll need it a year i won t have to pull out the manual every time as it s quite simple to operate i m real happy with it label poor choice this machine is a poor example of fax machine its alignment is bad its copys are bad it has a ink tape which was not explained i know this is a cheap machine but many things are inexpensive but is no excuse poor workmanship thank you carl williamsps this is why i am returning this product label good for home use i ve had this fax machine for a couple of years i don t use it a lot a couple of times a month on average and only for sending out i have received a few faxes and it s okay tho the printing quality isn t real good just okay i wouldn t recommend this fax machine for business use but if you re like me and just need to fax out now and then from home it s perfect label best fax ever okay i bought this fax machine to replace an old dinosaur fax i had since forever hands down this was the best minimal investment i ever made i don t know how i lived without this handy little workhorse it sends and recieves faces and it also makes black and white photocopies i paid less than dollars for this brother fax and that included shipping it came with ink pre installed and works beautifully a real bargain label pcm stereo sound is too bad the video footage is ok although the cuts between the different sets are too rough you don t get the impression to be on one concert you will think this is more a dvd with hector s music videos all lined up but the worst think is the sound no bass at all i got a sourround system but the pcm stereo sound on this dvd is too bad when you have an old tv and the complete sound comes out of it you may don t have a problem with the sound but i do how can someone who owns millions and gives an expensiv concert release the dvd in such a horrible sound wisin y yandel released their tomando control live dvd in sound label cheap cheap non wicking it s simply a cap with air holes almost meaningless since it s too big osfa it s floppy looks ridiculous if you ve got a big head lots of hair maybe you can wear ity under a helmet label unacceptable for road bikes caution be aware this product requires you to replace the skewer with their cheap supplied skewer if you have invested in all high end components this is not acceptable otherwise you will be completely rebuilding your ride between indoor and outdoor better not hope you get invited to a group ride the same day your bike is mounted on this piece of crap look for equipment that is more flexible in adjustment so that you truly have a quick in and out of the trainer label great product my husband and i each have a trainer and we think they are great they do need a bit of tweaking to get them just right and you can t coast but they still make for a great work out some mornings are too cold and too dark to ride outside and i find the trainer to be a great safe alternative this product is our first trainer and i doubt we will be needed another label mahjong i love buying at amazon for the products they sell and come on time great job i myself says now this game is fun if your a mahjong player like i am so everyone you ll like it like i have and beat it too label un happy the sword was well packed for shipping the grip was loose and the sword was stuck in the scabberd i thought it was rusted to remove it i removed the grip and with a pair of pliers and hammer i was able to remove it no rust the blade was to wide for the scabberd and i was unable to replace it i recommend buying a better quality sword label gundam wing ground zero this is so cool i read it on the internet and i had to buy it after that if ya like gundam wing you should realy get this it s awesome label shell shucked i can t believe how long it s taking this company to ship this order i think if i started shelling the sunflowers myself i would shell lbs before this order arrived i feel shucked over i would definately cancel this if i could label my birds are satisfied i ve ordered this product six times so far due to reasonable price free shipping and convenience of big bag so far the quality is good birds love it each time i make my own mix of birdfood i drool over the sunflower hearts and crave to make a salad for myself with sunflower seeds sprinkle over it no i didn t eat my bird s sunflower hearts but just want to say how good this product s quality is that its makes me want some too label lenox holiday china the china is beautiful the price was great and it was packaged nicely no damage in shipping it arrived quickly and i was delighted with the purchase hope the sale is repeated next year so i can add to my collection label incomplete guide very incomplete guide only few selected climbs in each area if general info is what you seek the guidebook is ok if you need a comprehensive guide to all the climbs it would be better to purchase guidebook locally label great little camera this camera is easy to use only needed instructions on setting date film loaded easily compact and fun great camera for the price label rilke songs et al a very pleasant album well performed we especially enjoyed the songs and the outstanding voice of lorraine hunt lieberson tragically taken from us far too soon label rip-off drum for more than the cost of this drum you can buy a brand new brother hl-n printer which includes not only this drum but also a new page toner cartridge although you have to follow instructions freely available on the internet to keep the toner cartridge from shutting down after pages a spare printer for free label a business trickery brother printers may be cheap but the drum units for them are not this is a classic business trickery they tease you with a cheap first buy then you have no choice but to continue buy the expensive parts furthermore the quality of the drum is not good either the company says that one drum unit can be used for pages assuming coverage this is not true the drum unit replaced with the original one in my printer had problems far before printing that number of pages based on coverage label exactly what we needed at a good price unfortunately our printer is now in need of other repairs and we are unable to take advantage of using our purchase label not bad for a boot but way overpriced should be free i always get steamed seeing somebody making money off of a boot that you can easily get for free if you are making money off of the show i suggest you pay the marley estate their share otherwise share it freely cause it ain t copyrighted if you want it for free just google bob marley quiet knight flac i suggest that amazon no longer carry this product label a must have cd as an amateur pianist i only listen to classical music casually so i m no expert on the great soloists of the violin however when i originally saw hilary playing on a local public tv station that runs a program that plays various classical music videos a little promotional documentary about this cd was playing and i was simply entranced by the music i heard becoming an instant fan i bought of her albums and this one i believe is head and shoulders above the rest i don t know if it s simply the selections of music by bach or her obvious mastery of the violin that make this cd such a joy to listen to for me all i know is that i can t wait to hear more recordings from this great musician label disappointing i heard hilary hahn live here in the netherlands and i was stunned by the performance she played bach the second partita it was amazing i was looking forward to listen to her bach violin concertos but when i heard them i was really disappointed she plays them technically perfect but this is not what i heard in the music hall her violin concertos are not inspiring they have no soul no meaning i wish she played them like she plays the bach partitas a dissapointed dutchmen label very beautiful if you are looking for a beautiful easy to listen to performance of bach this is a great recording if you are looking for a recording of a performer who pays attention to performance practice of baroque era music you will be disappointed vibrato is used throughout and the ornamentation leaves something to be desired all said though this is a beautiful recording that i enjoy even though i know that it is not as bach would have wanted it played label a misstep i have loved every previous hilary hahn recording and given them all stars this one is a distinct misstep it is just too fast i felt like punching my cd player to slow it down the playing is brittle lacking in character except for one of ths slow movements and wholly without interest had i heard this recording blind i never would have thought this was hilary hahn such a shame label a self-published page novel nuff said the first reviewers here are obviously the best friends of margaret doner this is a skimpy foray into too deep waters for a beginner have you ever read a good tudor biography that was only pages long can you imagine that there are any significant facts details insights in so few pages well you re rightthere aren t what we do have are stereotypes dirty old king lusty chaucerian wench stupid courtiers etc what is most egregious is that there is never even an attempt to explain why and how catherine and her cohorts could have made so many stupid mistakes how they could behave as if there had never been an anne bolyn that s the mystery that has always fascinated me about henry s rose without thorns but you ll find no answers here please save your money your time and be a bit more patient eventually someone is going to write a truly good historical novel about catherine howard label colored hair a bluish tint i have used the crew classic gray shampoo for years the shampoo in my last bottles is a very deep purple over time about months i would guess my hair has taken on a bluish tint the person cutting my hair noticed first i get my hair cut about once a month then my wife noticed the bluish tint began so slowly i really didn t notice much to my chagrin and self admonishment but when called to my attention my hair clearly had the faint bluish tint i have now changed shampoos after years of crew use i suspect it is something in the formula that was changed over the last year or so i of course don t know for sure but the color of the shampoo and the fact it was first noticed by the person who has been cutting my hair for years leads me to this conclusion david t label seek to see him it is most probable that the valentinians like the manichaeans and the naassenes at least were acquainted with thomas and incorporated some of its traditions into their works perhaps because it contains a negative world view and stresses knowledge as part of its soteriological scheme but gnostic use does not predicate gnostic origins we should be speaking of an influx of traditions found in thomas into gnosticism not the influx of gnosticism into thomas the future of research on possible connections between the gospel of thomas and gnosticism should be moving in the direction of exploring the influences that this non-gnostic gospel s ideology may have had on emerging second century gnostic systems label huge disappointment don t buy this book up until i found out about dr schwartz endorsing the female medium not ms dubois of which many of these reviews are speaking i would have said that his work was authentic and very beneficial to the field of mediumship i am incredibly disappointed that he would include this person on his list of reputable and respected mediums as this person is merely an actress nothing more she is preying on people who are grieving using them for her own personal gain dr schwartz you have done the public at large a great disservice and i no longer have any desire to read your work label phallic narcissism at it s finest gary schwartz writes like a classic phallic narcissist a clinical term used to describe people who elicit his type of behavior isn t it curious how he espouses over and over again being a clinical psychologist when in fact it is a lie anyone who would lie about their credentials would lie about their results in research don t believe the hype label not sure what i was expecting when i chose this book this book was about the scientific testing of allison dubois i know it says that on the cover but it seemed more like a brag book that s only my opinion it might seem wonderful to someone else but came across as almost self serving to me label how many sock puppets does it take should be the opening line of a bad joke but when someone mentioned in the book maligns the subject of the book while hiding behind the sweetness and light moniker askspirit me thinks something smells rotten in stinkville pee-u label cat got his tongue i felt the same way about the authors use of a cat metaphor to discribe gifted research mediums too bad if anyone could raise the bar on this profession i thought someone with his credentials could do so but i guess not cat got their tongue why no opinion on their website label the truth about the truth about medium this book promises the extraordinary including specific data from science experiments but what we get are more anecdotes about how great mr schwartz s experiments are he features highlights of experiments with medium allison dubois but schwartz bias in favor of his subject matter makes this book an epiphany of self-celebration there is a fascinating section the monty keen experiment and the results seem extremely remarkable why isn t it published in science magazine talk of replication and extension reading is confined to mr schwartz s lab and we re left wondering if any of schwartz s experimental designs or raw data are being shared with other universities why sacrifice scientific method for sensational tidbits oh yeah the book s release coincides exactly with the new fall tv season of medium label ugh this was the worst book i ve read in a long time no truth was revealed in this sloppily edited if at all book that was obviously just written in a hurry to cash in on the show medium s success confusing poorly written text i learned nothing don t waste your time or money on this one ugh label she s not mongolian or native siberian the author has adopted a mongolian name but she is not mongolian neither is she one of the native siberian peoples tread cautiously i thought her first book was terrible and self-serving like a recipe book with no rhyme or reason like all stories written by people who have gone native you really need to take this with a grain of salt label no good do not waste money and time reading this book stuff like this and recently the secret there are no other thing that new ways to some authors to make a lot of money based in people s ingenuousness label from the author of tales of ancient xenar yes my review here isn t for this book but for the author and the techniques he teaches i have read a lot of mr losier s works about the law of attraction and his works detail a lot of work to make it work in your favor he has you writing out whole lists of thing you want and don t want these list called clarity contrast lists i frankly don t like having to write pages of lists just to make something work for me my advice to all of you avoid stuff by michael losier label law of attraction this book has changed my understanding of how to attract what i want and to eliminate more of what i don t when things don t fit my vibration i immediately make adjustments i have totally taken charge of how i view the world incredible label this is not a law this is not science i can t believe people fall for this garbage the ideas presented in this book are done so without any regard to scientific method and the law of attraction is far from a law laws are absolute laws are proven laws are backed up by fact show me the proof that our bodies operate at a particular vibration and it is this vibration that either attracts or repels things in our lives this book does not offer that proof and neither can you sorry finding a winning lottery ticket on the ground is not proof that our bodies are vibrating or that finding that ticket was based on positive thinking be careful of any writing that proclaims something a universal law that clearly isn t don t get me wrong i m a big proponent of positive thinking and i feel it is helpful but the author is stealing your money by selling you false claims fantasies and untruths why would you spend your hard-earned money on a lie label simple fast way to change your thinking this book is for the terrible two s child within us i don t like this i don t like that it forces you to ask the simple question well what do you want amazingly adults may need to be reminded to of this the book goes on to develop techniques to answer the question and implement solutions as others have written may not be a major revelation but the author provides a reminder to discipline the inner child in straightforward manner that will get results label a book to succeed in writing excellent book to help you achieve success in all areas of your life get the principles shown here apply them and get the sucess you want recommended label dissappointed i do believe the audio cd would have been way better if narrated by mike losier himself instead you hear hugh gallager s narration which is monotone and lacking inspiration so dissappointed in his choice of narration i would probably reccomend buying the book instead label positive read a positive read to help you attract the things in life that make you happy and not drag you down great advice and inspirational read label a whole book for one simple concept i thought the book was way too basic there were many exercises that you had to do and write about in the book i thought most of it was there simply to fill up space since the main idea could be explained on one page i am giving it two stars instead of one because after all the author did try to write a book explaining how the law of attraction works two of my favorite books talking about the law of attraction are ask and it is given by e hicks and how to be wildly wealthy fast by s forster label a simple clear guide to manifestation i really enjoyed this book because it was brief direct concrete and offered clear worksheets that you could personalize for yourself or for coaching clients i think the inner work of changing your beliefs and vibration is very important in manifestation the one thing i would have liked included was an emphasis on action as well-ie i am a famous actor and i am actively applying for auditions many law of attraction books seem to leave out this action part label everything you need to know this is an excellent book very clear and easy to understand yet loaded with relevant information it s my new favorite label a great book for both begainner this is one of the best orchid encyclopedia i had seen so far many species are described both commonly grown and popular ones to unknowns the book cover wide range of genus and species esp with genus with fewer number of species the only set back is it didn t cover fully enough on certain family esp my favorite ones such as dendrobium vanda renanthera and cymbidium as lots of species seen to be missing in the encyclopedia never theless this is a great book and strongly recommanded for everyone with many reference to the photos label amazing very informative colorful interesting anyone could raise orchids with this book it makes it easy label colton s review i purchased this product for my year old son amazon had it when it was nowhere else to be found it was delivered to our home within days thank you amazon label bumblebee transformer don t waste your it s crap i was under the impression that the price meant better quaility and durablilty but with this product that was untrue the simaliar bumblebee transformer was at walmart for that was the same quality and durability my son recieved this toy on christmas day it is now the th of december and the head has already fallen of times the door has come off twice what a waste of money this product sucks i wish i could get my money back for this piece of crap label call me ichabod i gave this to my year-old nephew for his birthday he freaked out the best gift ever i love you aunt jill exactly the reaction you hope for when you give a kid a gift three days later my nephew called to inform me that sadly bumblebee had been decapitated but he still called it the best gift ever so i guess bumblebee doesn t really need a head to be fun label average at best there aren t alot of cuts here that i dig on a whole but a cut like move your body is a fun jam truth is most of these acts belong on this kind of compilation because to have to sit through a whole disc of there stuff would put you to sleep i can see the appeal of these type of compilations because as i ve said before some of these acts at best are looking at song careers at most label not this one id just like to know how to get a refund the remote worked golden for the first set of batteries when they went dead though all the keys froze to completely different settings and when i replaced the batteries and tried to reprogram it its officially broken label read ads very closely well i am really thankful i read all of the reviews and noticed this price was for bowl only that is insane wal-mart carries the corelle line of dishes and you can buy those bowls there for a couple of dollars a piece i am surprised amazon allows dealers to rip people off like that i have always bragged about amazon to my friends and recommended them to everyone good to know they do not always make their vendors do the right thing i ll keep that in mind when shopping here and read all the fine print label great plates these plates are great they don t chip or break and wash easily these smaller plates are especially good for portion control i ve got a whole set and would readily buy more these are also good for little hands that like to drop things label just another crappy cd made quickly to rob you este disco se debe de aver tomado uno o dos dias para grabar solo es algo que isieron rapidamente para que la gente lo comprara despues del no merecido exito de dos locos no gasten su dinero paisas por favor esto es basura solo miren la portada y se daran cuenta label love it perfect size for aspiring artists love this size and brand winsor makes great canvases the size is great for aspiring artist because its big enough to actually work with but not so big that you ll have extra space use a lot of paint or will have a problem hanging it also great because if you sell your work its perfect size and keeps costs low so that your work will actually sell shipped fast great price was as expected label is bad pictures i ve been using this camera for about mos already upgrading from a point shoot olympus clamshell camera and was very much dissappointed with the quality of the pictures it definitely looks cool but the output was terrible overexposure dark backgrounds i tried auto mode and manual mode can t say more but i am definitely not recommending this camera label auto camera with manual preciseness i ve had a manual-focus camera for years set apertures speeds etc this camera gives you all the exactness of that medium with the total convenience and ease of a fully automatic package plus you can set your own apertures if you wish to move outside the box and the camera sets the speed for you the settings are easy to figure out auto focusing is a bit tricky but once you get the hang of it there s nothing easier great versatility in a reasonably priced package i highly recommend it label lenox china i purchased this to give as a gift the product is exactly what i expected and i got a great price label five stars for cynthia rylant i suggest cynthia rylant s henry and mudge books to every little grandchild that love to read or be read to my granddaughter loves all cynthia s stories every book is new adventure label azure bonds action magic intrigue qualities i like in a novel all of that and more were included in this interesting story label good story well-written pleasant summer reading recommended pleasant summer reading good story well-written nicely told donna huston murray has a fine touch with her pen label more short simple and readable potato chip editorials once again the texts of several of charles colson s breakpoint radio commentaries are collected into the book format as with a dance with deception which i finished a short while ago the short editorials focusing on the difficulties with maintaining a fundamental christian world view in a seeming increasingly harsh and anti-christian world are readable and more importantly thought provoking recommended label good but not as good as the first two i really liked this book but i thought that the first two of the trilogy were better i didn t really like the ending or the deaths of some of the characters but all in all a good book label if you re looking for a graphic novel keep looking i m sorry i was looking for something with a little more art this isn t the first comic to cross over into novel form too bad amazon shopers can t actually see the merchandise they are buying the description of the book is a little ambiguous it may be a well written book but i was looking for graphic novels and this did mention that there were illustrators for the novel i wish i knew that there would only be a few illustrated pages label helping your child understand how things work while the information in this book is somewhat dated published in it contains good cut-away pictures and explanantions of basic everyday methods of transportation boats planes cars as well as telephones rockets etc that are easy to understand for the younger child not toddler my children thoroughly enjoyed this book when they were growing up and i am replacing their worn-out copy for my grandson who is also enjoying it label he s the best i have bought the entire paul check physio-ball video series i also have videos from other instructors and paul s are by far the best he knows the body so well and explains how and why to do things so you can understand i feel scientifically grounded in my knowledge i teach a weekly class on the physio-ball and have incorporated everything i learned from this and the first video exercises for abs and buns be ready for a challenging workout label not what i thought i felt that i was misled i was under the impression that this was the original soundtrack it was not label awesome what a great group of musicians i have been a fan since i first heard about them while i was still working in radio label awesome recipes awesome recipes quite a bit of soy used in a lot of the receipes though but great recipes nevertheless makes lo carb fun and easy label great addition to protein power the regular hamburgers and grilled meat was getting old i tried this and got some low carb breads and sweets i think that i can stick to the diet now the recipes that i have tried so far have been good label you must pick this up i m a third-year medical student and i ve been worrying for some time now about how i d decide what specialty to go into of course nothing substitutes for some good old-fashioned soul-searching but dr freeman s book will certainly kick your inner dialogue into gear what impressed me most about this book was the quality of informationeverything was accurate up-to-date and written in an engaging way i learned many things about each of the specialties i am consdering that i d never read anywhere else i also appreciated the fact that each specialty chapter is written by someone who s actually been there done that they re all written by residents overall i highly recommend this book to any medical student who is pondering what specialty to choose label very useful for the application-oriented if your primary interest is in writing compression algorithms this is the book you want it does a fine job of explaining several different techniques and shows you how to implement them it s light on the theory side so if you re more interesting in the why than the what you may want to choose a different book one exception to this is the explanation of arithmetic coding and statistical methods which can actually be read and understood in one pass label sounds like a typical movie soundtrack album i admit it i read all the extremely positive reviews and was duped into thinking that this album was somehow set apart from all other movie soundtracks so i ran out and purchased it however after listening to it i was truly disappointed there is nothing striking or significant about this piece the movie is outstanding and the music within the movie context is fitting however extract the music from the movie and what you have are tracks that all sound about the same to sum it up in one word boring now if your interested in powerful moving music that stands apart might i suggest the schindler s list soundtrack the violin solos by itzhak perlman are truly outstanding label disappointing i ordered this movie going off the other reviewers on amazon and boy was i wrong it was long cheesy and just pure uninteresting the casting was done well and hritik and sanjay really played their parts but that was the only saving grace there was a song and dance number every-time you turned around while they were mediocre in nature they did not help advance the story line in any shape or form the story itself is far fetched and is not fathomable by any stretch label fram is poor quality the standard fram oil filters are considered one of the poorest quality oil filters on the market they have cardboard internal end caps and irregular filter medium held together by clips these are constructed in canada and quality control doesn t seem all that good as someone else mentioned go to youtube and look up oil filter comparisons you ll see how inferior fram is compared to other brands i used fram for years but will not buy any more after seeing these dramatic comparisons label this is a wonderful book it is a replacement copy for the st one i had it arrived in good condition within the delivery window i am very happy to have it again thank you label excellent behind the scenes shots this is a great addendum to the dune miniseries on the sci-fi channel i thoroughly enjoyed the color section in the middle of the book and reading about the director and production of the expensive series the dvd that came with it was fun but long winded at times when the interviewees went into what they believed to be frank herbert s desires but how could they know anyway a good book for the dune fan to pick up label very poor logic and writing ability this book and the authors approach to the subject is extremely elemental he clearly is not too intelligent or does not have much to say label if you are italian do not read this book typical obvious re placement and recently all too common italian american as disgusting classless filthy villain movie producer makes this book a real disapointment so boring to make the italian the new interchangeable bad white guy tired and boring label painful full of painfully obvious cliches i was insulted on so many levels i don t know where to begin save yourself the pain run don t walk label awful read this book was a waste of time american beauty was a far superior read i know this was evelyn nesbit s memoirs but it was hard to follow as it was badly written and very disjointed label ok for surfing the internet but if you want to stream or download anything forget it if all you want to do is surf the internet or check e-mail it s probably fine if you ever need to download something wrap the adapter in ice first because after mb or so it will overheat and kill your connection label does not work with ps3 i recently purchased this product with the expectation that i would be able to plug in the adapter and instantly use my guitar hero guitars this was not the case when i got the adapters the first thing i noticed was the packaging which stated the product was a ps2 to usb pc adapter the ps3 has usb ports so i thought this wouldn t be a problem however upon plugging the adapter in i found it wouldn t register the guitars after further investigation and several minutes of frustration i noticed a disc included in the packaging marked drivers obviously this presented a problem as the drivers had to be loaded in order to use the adapters as i haven t yet found a way to load drivers in to the programming of the ps3 i was unable to use the adapters with the console bottom line don t buy these adapters for use with you ps3 there are adapters out there that are specifically made for the ps3 and work for that application label does not work with gh3 we had one of these adapters anyway and just bought guitar hero iii legends of rock yesterday the adapter does not work with this game the ps button brings up the console screen but no scrolling is possible and it takes control away from any other guitar connected if you can actually get it into gameplay the symptoms are similar to those experienced with other guitar hero games no star power deployment using tilt etc don t buy this if you want to play guitar hero on ps3 suck it up and get the new wireless guitar s made for the system label gives you a short burst of energy i have been taking this and have lost no weight at alli am alert for a whilei have never been one to eat much at all so appetite was not the problem just gained weight stomach etc for no reason i exercise on a machine i m on less than calorie diet healthy foods still weight is herei give it to stars because with that short burst of energy at least i get a little bit of work done around the house good luck peoplemy normal weight lbs out of the blue got up to no reason i work out on exercise machine tells u how many fat cals you burn have to burn those first to get rid of the real fat so if you find something that will get rid of belly fat let me know cause i eat very little take these pills and nothing label two of the best albums on one disc these two albums a lot to fear and plant a tree or die are the first efforts and arguably the best from the environmentally active boston hardcore band tree the sound is heavy and raw the breakdowns are clever the lyrics thought provoking and energized in their heyday tree toured with clutch one listen to this disc and you ll see why it ll leave you nodding your head long after the last track ends label why i was dissapointed in this product i bought this for my child because it combined a craft like project and gardening i was very disspointed to find that you cannot use the markers or the paint provided in any way with this as the tray it comes with is plastic and just comes off it comes with many seeds however only enough soil pellets to plant seedlings this just frustrated us more i would not recommend this item label i was sent wrong bracket by seller yes i know my review is really late but i just now tried to install this bracket i had originally bought it nearly a year ago but never got around to installing it as i didn t feel like removing hosing from tankless water heater but today during yearly maintenance i tried to install it and found it didn t fit i was sent the wrong bracket i was very disappointed label oh wow we got the recipe and a wonderful book to read every christmas to remind you what is important esther s gift is very short but the perfect book to get you in the mood for christmas i will remember to read it every year label using asp net a bit what a disappoitment this book is full of errors i m not talking of trivial errors either but of the jaw-dropping variety for instance in chapter the author keeps referring to the web config file as config web additionally i ve already come across several other major errors in the code examples more than found in the online errata section i guess listing them all would be too embarrassing sure the book is an easy read it s an easy read because it s neither in-depth nor detailed often a lot of concepts in the code examples are never explained properly using asp net if you use this book the errors and the lack of in-depth coverage will leave you dazed you will end up with more questions than answers and you will soon be looking for a better book to help you learn asp net in earnest label a nice package all around this is really a very nice collection of love songs from elvis i wish the tracking order had been in chronoligcal order by year but otherwise i m very happy with the collection i purchased it for the unreleased studio version of for the good times which is nice but in my opinion does not come close to the live version on the madison square garden album for those that are new to elvis thanks to the hits and nd to none collections this will be a great way to hear a little of the different styles of music elvis was capable of i do have to say that unchained melody is a stand out on here as every elvis fan knows that this was close to the end for him but the voice was stronger than ever sure elvis fans will have these songs in their collections already but the remastering job by vic anesini is stellar and it brings new life to these classics and will not disappoint label this book is great it has been a long time since i read a book that i enjoyed so thoroughly part european travelogue buruma travels from voltaire s home in ferney to germany to holland and to great britain part philosophical reflection part history and part autobiography buruma ties together all the strands in a perfectly beautiful bow wonderfully written with unforgettable profiles of major historical and literary figures laughter is forbidden announced the germans as they produced shakespeare s plays but laughter tears and insights are the inevitable outcome of a few hours curled up with anglomania a european love affair label five really bad games and one that s pretty good most of the games in this pack are either terrible or won t run on your pc the only one that is any good is sim golf and you can get that separately the other five games combined aren t worth a dollar several of them wouldn t even run on either of my computers because they have such compatability issues with windows label not that much good well not that much what i am except not cheap not big very normal oil better looking at some where else label porsche fan as a long time fan and witness to many racing wins and one who has met some of the drivers mentioned in this book i highly recommend this book to porsche racing fans one of the surprising aspects of the book is its insights into the personalities and technologies that played out during their dominance of this era very insightful and informative lots of quotes from drivers engineers ceo s and designers too many color pictures adds to the enjoyment label fun my baby got this for his st birthday and really loves it it is bright and eyecatching and sits just right in the corner of our deck the lid is easy to put on and off and nice and light although does not blow off in the wind it holds at least bags of play sand from home depot and could easily hold more it can hold toddlers comfortably and has provided lots of fun so far the one and only issue is that i often sit on the front claws so i can play with my baby they have now dented badly and i am not hugely heavy either there was no mention of not sitting on it so i had thought it would be durable enough this isn t to put anyone off from buying this sandbox just don t perch on the end of it label crabbie sandbox i have purchased this sandbox for my boys years and years old they just love it and can not get enough of playing in it i put pound bags of playsand in it and that is sufficient for them label hoot my daughter really wanted this movie and it was scratched very badly i was disappointed that her christmas gift was such poor quality label sorry but in the fifth grade our teachers showed this movie to us on dvd as a special activity in celebration of valentine s day i cannot really remember the film very well because i was too busy clowning around at the back of the room with a few classmates in order to avoid having to watch it it just did not capture my interest years later i went online and read about the summary of the book and concluded that i really had not missed out on something that i would regret having missed out on since it s just another little-guy-against-big-corporation story i am very sorry if i ve offended anybody with my critique of this film because it is fine with me if you love it i just did not also i apologize to the makers of this film if i have insulted them and also to the author who wrote hoot if this review has or would offend him it just didn t interest me i am verry sorry to say label hoot the movie it s a great movie i would also suggest reading the book my th graders had to read it for school i would recommend to anyone of any age it is a story about a boy who moves to florida who meets some interesting people label no respect for dads not like the book at all in the book the dad is an intelligent supportive figure it is he who reviews the building department file and discovers a key to stopping construction in the movie they give the credit for this completely to the son in the movie the father is a less-than-supportive stereotyped authority figure who isn t all that bright typical hollywood put down the father figure at every opportunity label matt s the best matt worked on several shoots for me while he was assisting one of the top photographers in the country matt s knowledge of his craft was exceptional he was the consummate professional in every aspect one of his finest qualities was to be tireless or appear to be while on the job working long hours he never complained about the ridiculous tasks being asked of him and always offering suggestions on how to improve a shot every assistant could learn something good from this remarkable person label innocents abroad on a recent cruise in the mediterranean i was told by guides and fellow travelers that mark twain s innocents abroad was a must to read twain is always a treat to read and the parallels between his travels and travails and those of a st century tourist are striking would recommend for any before or during a european tour especially one on water label steering wheel this shot was garbage it came with missing parts ring color scratched and beat up the worst thing i have ever paid for bitch face fungi chicken wings and booty swet label not a sturdy wheel just bought one of these wheels had no problem installing software after one day the power cord does work anymore no power to the wheel or pedals gonna have to take the wheel back now not going to get another one label great bokken i am in no way an experienced swordsman but i feel that this bokken is great it is considerably lighter than an actual katana but i think most bokkens are that way it is very impact resistant to the point of being almost indestructible once i accidentally hit a support beam pillar with full force don t ask and i found no trace of damage on the bokken the only flaw i see is that polypropylene is not as dense as wood so the bokken is easily damaged by sharp objects and can be cut by bladed weapons this is not really an issue unless you decide to channel musashi and fight a katana with a bokken label bokken great and tough cold steel makes great products but it is a little on the light side for a good work out label wonderfully told story of coming of age lesley does a great job describing the awareness of culver as he meets challenges growing up without a father culver s mother is a strong influence on the boy but the real character he tries to emulate is his uncle who is a real outdoor s man i have enjoyed all of lesley s books and this one was also very good label not near as good as the x in size these are at best ok they dry out super fast you can barely get your hands wiped before the wipe has totally dried out label wonderful i bought these to put in my twin year old boys school lunches i love the fact that they really use them even when i m not there they remind me if i ever forget to put one in their lunch label most recent calphalon purchase this set is great as is all the other calphalon products i ve ordered from amazon label very disappointed i am very disappointed in this product yes it tells time it s compact it s cute and it has different display colors but after only a couple months the alarm stopped going off on the display you can see the blinking buzz but without sound alarm label pretty nice alarm clock this is a really nice alarm clock the screen is really nice and clear and it isn t super loud when the alarm goes off the only downfall s with this are it is pretty small and it is a bit bright and you can t dim it more label deceiving the product itself works great however the description is very deceiving because it is not the size the description suggests label easy to use but just fine i have a problem waking up in the morning and so i use a couple of alarms this alarm allows one to have different colors for display which is good but i wonder how useful it is pro the alarm is smallits sturdycon the plastic makes it look cheap but that is not a reason to complain either the volume level is fixed not as loud as i thought somewhere not worth the price but guess thats what can give label what time is it well this clock arrived and i was excited as i really needed a new clock and liked the idea of being able to change the color of the lcd surprise the clock s lcd didn t light up at all which means you can t tell the timekind of a deal-breaker when you buy a digital clock this was the second clock i ordered in less than a month that arrived defective so this was pretty annoying label wonderful insightful hysterical need i say more hmmmm let s see what else can i say i love this book sarah vowell is a brilliant young writer with a biting sense of humor this collection echoes i suspect the sentiments of many disillusioned americans make that millions who still wonder how in the wild wild world of sports dubbya became president beyond that however is a sweet and funny look into the heart of this talented woman as she takes us though some darn interesting moments in her coventional-yet-not-really-coventional upbringing she s funny she s smart she s funny and smart hers is a voice that stands out in a sea of mediocre essayists trust me agree or disagree with her politics you ll still enjoy her sense of history as it relates to our world today label the stickers rock at cents for each sticker this book is the bargain of all time the sticker slogans are super cool and the quality is as good as individually sold stickers so my recommendation is to load up on this book you ll never buy stickers this cheap again label not so sticky the stickers have many great sayings but they re not as sticky as ones i ve bought at record shops and other places in a collage of stickers gathered from many places these were the only ones to peel up on their own within two days label best gift yet i have bought multiple copies of this book for gifts it is a huge hit with all ages from teenagers to youthful adults buy several to keep on hand you won t be sorry label very cool collection but disappointing while all the slogans are great and the amount of stickers is more than enough i was quite disappointed in the quality the description above clearly says the sticker are vinyl they are not and seem to be paper either way they barely stick to anything i put them on if at all and are easily damaged when wet sure its a book of cheap stickers but i was really hoping they would last on my car more than a trip to the store before falling off i suppose if you re looking to sloganize your workspace or public places then go ahead and get the book if you re looking for quality stickers spend a few bucks on select slogans and go for quality label i give up this book is unreadable i ve read the first chapter at least times and believe me i don t mind doing a little literary heavy lifting i love james joyce and some of the other authors mentioned by reviewers who liked this book maybe it gets better but the first chapter with this unknown character picking at her blemishes and fantasizing about sucking out all the pus and rubbing her own breasts sorry not for me label too difficult to get hay out i thought this looked like a good idea but actually my bunny can t get the hay out of it instead she knocks it down everyday so she can eat out of the top and when she can t knock it down she doesn t eat any i would not buy this again you might as well put the hay in a bowl label shame on the record companies that release inferior-quality product i purchased this cd and was very disappointed because of the poor sound quality this was obviously not made from the original masters as the volume is very low and the music has no dynamic range whatsoever instead of buying this inferior-quality cd i recommend your buying the una dimension de exitos cd because its sound quality is much better in every way label are you kidding the book is a non starter it will be silly to beleive that this is all they ask for the exam because there is absolutely no solid information at all towards the end you will feel that the authors wrote this book while watching jerry springer show they simply did not seemed to care about it anymore page the only information about samba is a half page print out of the homepagepage unnecessary lengthy etc hosts file are printed times page half page printout of homepageright from the beginning the book is crammed with serious mistakes my estimate is that if the authors try hard for about years they will start to understand linux then they will have to spend another years to become good in it only after that should they even think about teaching linux label wonderful pack of mistakes page a zombie is a process whose parent has terminated and cannot clear references to the child process he even goes one more level and says chare kwmthe output of ps indicates that the process is now a zombie and is owned by the init process this clearly shows his ignorance about the basic definition of a zombie process what else do you expect from someone whose only experience is clicking some silly microsoft buttons shame on you authors it makes me so angry that some cheap ms guy managed to get guy from me for this useless book by the way a zombie process is a process which is already dead and hence the name zombie but whose parent is still alive but has not yet asked for the process termination status so the os still keeps parts of the dead process process table thinking that some time later the parent is going to ask for the status wait system call this results in the wastage of system resources label sweet and small but lovely as well while the necklace is small as other reviewers have stated and a little flatter than the photo reflects it is still graceful and sweet and nice quality i am overall pleased with the product and would order again if need arises label poor quality my son bought it for his mom for mothher s day i must say the packaging was acceptable but the chain started to turn grey to black within one week of use this has disappointed my son because it is the first time he has actually purchase something for his mom i am presently seeking my money back label great modern christmas album i always reach for this album when i want to listen to something christmas-y but am sick of all the traditional songs this album has a nice mix of new christmas songs and new takes on old ones i particularly like the ones by harry connick jr and dido i scoffed at it when my husband brought it home but once i listened to it i loved it actually i m listening to it write now and it inspired me to buy a few albums by some of the artists label the whole series is stars the entire series is one that i enjoy reading over and over it has crime solving romance and the supernatural her ideas on the afterlife in the books are very thought provoking for anyone who likes vampires werewolves etc this is a must read label looking for the rest of the book broken was a bit of a disappointment it is a quick read and not a bad book but i was looking for a little bit more there are a number of storylines that are introduced throughout the book but none of them really mature it left me wanting more which isn t a problem that i normally have with ms armstrong s books even the main storyline with the portal unleashing a jack the ripper-like killer seemed shallow there is little pack interaction the witches are only mentioned jamie pops in with a narrative hook that goes nowhere the newest vampire seems to be more comic relief than much else as i m reading it occurred to me that the book just well seemed tired and other readershave commented that this is the last elena book evidently i m not the only one thinking tired since there is a teaser for a new series by armstrong in the back that looks interesting and different it is about a woman completely of this world according to the teaser label a mature immature book i guess i am the minority with my review i thought this book was a yawn shock value aside incest and rape along with a shocking surprise at the end it read like a high-schooler s angsty prose i found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought just to get to the point i rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd the book is a quick read i finished it in about an hour i wish i had just taken it out at the library instead of spending on something i can read in one sitting all in all the material is meant for mature readers but the style is clearly not a lot of reviewers say that the love between the main character and her brother is just beautiful but i failed to see the beauty in animalistic um stuff between siblings in my opinion this book is purely shock value with no substance so if that is your thing then go for it label be careful before using any inversion therapy talk with your orthopedic doctor as use may aggrevate inflame or even cause further damage to those suffering from back pain there are also studies that show ocular eye damage may occur due to the increase in blood pressure strokes are also a possibility be forewarned label dvd information didn t play the dvd did not play anywhere i tryed on dvds players and a computer could you please send a new copy to me also i saw on tv that they are offering the same product for for a try-out but i payd for mine what s going on thanks luiz coelho label goes with everything i bought this cardigan because it looked a little more dressy and i liked the way it looked paired with the tank which i also bought in mauve i was surprised whtne the cardigan went with everything it is longer than i expected so it goes well with the tunics that were in style this fall winter i also love the detailing of the sleeves and the little pockets the material is soft and has the slightest sheen to it i can t imagine it becomeing fuzzy or dull anytime soon what i love most about the cardigan is that it is very versitile so far i ve worn it with tanks and turtlenecks every color imaginable i bought it in white the versatility also means it can go with dressy business and casual wear and i ve worn all three it has become a staple in my wardrobe label not what i exspected from eva ok the series was great no doubt about that but this video well lets just say it wasent entertaining at all they could have made it much better but all it seemed to be was shinji in a chair lots of flashbacks and talking its not really the end and it makes you want to see more but this was such a disapointment to me i returned it back to the store itll be good to see just for the sake of seeing it but not worth sorry but the onley reason this got a star is becuase it was the subtitled japanese verion and the last mins was cool well thats all i have to say sorry it also make you wonder if the creator had any mentle problems label huh excuse me but did i miss sumthing i mean one minute rei is blowing up her eva the next you go into the minds of the pilotswhat the hell p s does anyone know where to get the moves in english in australia label excelent videos ruined by the end it has been said that a good story teller doesn t tell you a story but insteads allows you to find out about the story yourself through clues and other hints that is what has made the first twelve videos so extraordinary and that is what loses me on the last one the instramentality project as singe accepting that he has more worth then he thinks he does geesh i would hope that the world has not been spending countless dollars and man hours on a project that allows people to figure out something that they would eventually figure out themselfs sorry guys the movie ending makes much more sense to me label emotionally satisfying and endearing patrick gale has written yet another fine book full of believable characters and unpredictable plots i have read all of his books and found them to be consistently well written entertaining and thought-provoking this book delves into the infinite complexities of human relationships but does not become ponderous his sudden and eccentric plot twists keep the reader stimulated and guessing this book may seem dark at first but don t give up there is a rare treat in store i have eagerly awaited patrick gale s each new offering for the last years and have yet to be disappointed label campy good fun i am a fan of the stage show and yet i still love this movie first of all dolly parton is miss mona she is perfectly charming this movie is like grease let me explain the movie doesn t match the stage show and yet it stands on it s own and has become a cult classic it is even better on dvd it s widescreen and you get to see so much more label unsubstantiated account this book has no basis for the items presented as facts obviously not a song critic the author shows no appreciation at all for the lyrics and verse that captured and still captures the world the accounts of john denver s personality were also written as fact instead of the farce that it is members of his family children and ex-wives continue to praise on camera-his gentleness and giving this is not the book to read if you want insight into a man who gave the world his genius and his hope for a better world in the only way he knew to share this hope he was however a man and problems he had with alcohol and relationships are outlined in his autobiography and not very different from the evils many people face from day to day label all about collis i was vastly disappointed in this book it would only rate a c as a freshman term paper collis mostly writes his gut level reaction to denver s songs and the cultural events of the fifties through nineties with absolutely no attempt to analyze or substantiate why on a book about denver do we have a page and a half about rosa parks was denver there with her on the bus one would find more content on denver s life in a people magazine article label excellent text for a working process engineer as a process engineer working in both operations and design in the upstream oil industry it is pleasing to find a text that finally covers all the unit operations you are likely to encounter in oil processing the book is an easy read that doesn t get weighed down in first principles this means that you can quickly get the information you require and have confidence in your decisions it s a must for anyone working in the industry especially those who may be offshore i always have my copy with me label above average military sci-fi ditto this book and the previous one semper mars both provide solid summer escape reading unlike sherman cragg s starfist or diehl s legion of the damned series douglas s characters are actually believable for those of you who like douglas s ie bill keith s work i also recommend his seals the warrior breed series written under another pseudonym h jay riker while not exactly sci-fi this is a great series for techno-thriller buffs label read my review of semper mars and you know i was a non-combat coast guardsman my marine friends lived a different life than i wonderfully written great continuation of sempervivum mars experience label i m a programmer this is necessary i m a computer programmer and i use all those funky buttons on the keyboard all day long i appreciate the layout of the page-up home end keys and such if you do a lot of typing i think you need an adjustable keyboard those microsoft and logitech split keyboards are poor substitutes you ve still got to make sure to stretch and take breaks the keyboard isn t a miracle however i would not be able to do my job with a normal keyboard label rip off i bought this book for college microbiology it was a decent price but when i went to my first class the professor had us check to see if we had all the chapters this book does not it s missing chapters so if you need them i would not get this book label perfect genre material of the late s the acid trip scene is worth the price of admission alone a perfect teen parent clash of what life was like in the late s a must-own for people age over label great phone its been a while since i found a phone that i can respect and say oooohhhh and ahhhhh to this is the phone great design great features and cool ui all the features u can possibly want wireless connectivity is excellent the music feature is great and the speaker is the loudest i have ever heard on a phone the only thing that i have to pick on a little is the earpiece volume it could be a little louder but that all depends on how u put it against your ear play around with the position and the volume changes dramatically label poor quality while the easy pour feature is nice the plastic itself is very poor quality it makes the milk smell plasticy is fragile and leaks also the area you write on is in the same place the milk is so it makes it hard to write and you also run the risk of puncturing the bag unless you use a permanent marker or something similar in my opinion the nice easy pour feature isn t worth wasting the money on the bags i reccommend lansinoh brand bags label small portraits but great quality this is a very cute kit with a good variety of subjects from the eiffel tower to a rocket in space the guide included was great at showing what colors are needed for each portrait and what colors you will need to mix i do think that the quality of the brush could be better and the portraits were a bit smaller than i would have liked i had to squint quite a lot for some pictures to make sure the right paint got in the right spot but i really had fun with this kit and would buy it again label good pictures but unusable the paints were all dried out and not able to be used the pictures are incredibly small and the lines are way to faint i think you pay for the book of the history of paint-by-numbers which frankly i could care less about i am writing a not to the company and am very unsatisfied with this product label paint boards too small i bought this for my year old daughter who does a lot of paint by numbers she didn t like this kit because of the size of the paintings the actual paintings are about x7 card size they are really small there is no way they can expect you to paint this in a tiny dot so small it is more advanced in my opinion in that you are supposed to use their drawing as guidelines and paint over it how you want you will never be able to fill in the little sections label kinda boring pragraph of school work changes by abby this story was kinda boring or maybe even all boring but i just had to read it for school i thought it was becuase it was extremley slow some of the chapters only talked about depress depress and depress it was kinda interesting in some chapters i thought rosamunde didnt really realize how rude she was and poor izzy had to go through her i would have told her to shutup to listen to me i think that marco should have been punished marco should have been put into jail or his driver s license should have been taken away i think rosamunde should have been nicer it was nice of lisa to respond to the action mature and not freak out like suzy and lauren in the begining tony would stand up for izzy and she would have never lost her leg label ok but really boring i had to read this book for summer reading like so many other kids it wasn t too bad but most of it was just boring half the book your reading about izzy while she s in the hospital and it just gets so boring i m a boy and i think this book was targeted towards girls but i had to read it for school the book tried to make you feel sorry for izzy buy you know what i wasn t sorry for her the characters were so dull and boring i didn t care about them at all label nicole s revised review of izzy willy-nilly this book was not that good for me it went too slow i like adventure books and this is not one of them my book is about izzy goes to a party her date was drinking and they got into a wreck she had to get her leg amputated she got really depressed because she was in a stuffy hospital and her room was just plain it wasn t different which she liked being different from everybody else when she got to go home she found out she had to get a fake leg i would recommend this book to anyone who likes books that go slow and are boring this book just went on and on talking she described every little detail i could just fall asleep reading this book label this book is boring this book is really boring i advise u not to read it you ll fall a sleep reading it don t read it label what was the point of this book i had to read this book for summer reading and found that it was really bad izzy went on a date with a senior who she didn t really like and then went home with him even though he was drunk she got in an accident and lost her leg abandoned by her friends she befriended an odd girl named rosamunde who she d never really liked before izzy was too absorbed in being liked and nice and i didn t understand why she would t take a ride home with the guy she had a crush on when he offered i thought that the izzy in her head that did cartwheels that she was always mentioning made no sense i found the parts where izzy was in the hospital really boring and her parents bugged me instead of being happy that she d made a friend who visited her and kept her happy her mom was worried that rosamunde wasn t izzy s type the story had no heart it didn t make me like the characters it didn t make me happy it didn t make me sad it was just boring label izzy willy-nilly this book was a very well written book the story about izzy was very realistic this is a good story for teenagers to read about drinking and driving and about how it can ruin your life to go to a life that is perfect to not so perfect is very hard to deal with i would recommend all this book to all teenagers label not as good as previous models this tester is not as good as previous models my employer has an older tester of this make and model and it works much better than this one label hysterically touching this is my favorite jack lemmon movie i first saw it about years ago when it was recommended to me by my girlfriend at the time in fact i loved the movie so much i followed the plot and left her check it out it is worthwhile label battery lasted months when i first received this battery it worked fine but after months it will no longer hold a decent charge i can t talk on my cordless phone for longer than minutes i am going to order a replacement battery from a different manufacturer that has a star rating by the way of comparison the original battery i got with the phone lasted years label worth every penny sonia uvezian has provided us with a truly engaging scholarly exploration of one of the world s most exciting culinary traditions if you want to become knowledgable about armenian cooking this exceptional book which is packed with valuable information and splendid recipes you won t find elsewhere is essential label nice pens great pens for the price just remember to put the cap on when not in use makes writing easy label aaaaah i can t believe i bought a cassete player for this ok i think maybe a year old may benefit from this tape this whole freaking tape was common sense just about i learned one thing in this whole tape i don t think the other reviewers were reviewing the same thing there is nothing good about this tape please believe me and dont get it please label cool magician saw the guy in person loved the show ordered the book for a nephew so he could try some of the tricks written for kids to be able to do label ceo s dream book for managing business processes i have read a few hundred non-fictional books over the years for my mba for quality etc but i have to tell you that this book about the use of balanced scorecards is the best business related book that i have ever read and i feel that every ceo should completely absorb it to utilize its pertinent applications that are applicable to their business processes thus institutionalizing the process metrics continual improvement concepts of iso ts and iso in all types of firms including those that are not automotive suppliers bill cooper global quality systems senior manager lear corporation label one of the best books i ve ever read there are only a few stories that haunt me this is one of them i read this years ago and am watching parts of it slowly come true things that were novel and futuristic when i first read it are everyday occurances now i wonder how much more of the book will come to life label call me mrs miracle the dvd came packaged well the dvd is good quality and plays well like having the information about the dvd available inside the case label call me mrs mircle the second part of this movie is move than excellent to be watched time is worth watching this again and again and watched at least more than ten times label too little or too late i ordered this book on a recommendation as a solution unfortunately it was not the right solution for me though it certainly may be for others personally i find life becoming more and more multi-dimensional and multi-faceted with multitudinous opportunities and challenges reducing wounds to five and then pinning body types on certain wounds with certain recipies for healing was just too reduced for my taste it forced me to identify with all the wounds and all the body types and simply didn t take who i am in into consideration but again maybe it s just me label not as good as the real thing i bought this cd expecting something very similar to an original cast recording however this cd has little to no resemblance to the offical soundtrack the lyrics are the same and the vocals are somewhat similar to the real thing but instrumentally this cd is lacking it sounds like the cd was put together using a keyboard however for someone not quite as picky as i am this is a great listen the words are moving and the music though not holding to webber s original score is good label midori is eloquent and smart the psychology aesthetics and philosophy of erotic power exchange d s and s m written with wit imagination and intelligence for someone new to bdsm it may help with self-acceptance and confidence for all levels it may enhance your own understanding of what it is that we do label another terrible book like osterbrock this is another of the books i had to use for my graduate ism course i dont know what the problem is but every book ive read on the ism was terrible at explaining things because confusion in this subject is very easy and none of them have an index thats worth a crap so dont expect to be able to do the homework problems in there dopita is written a little better than osterbrock and there isnt the ridiculous amount of tables strewn within the text but its not much better label bring t tm back hi i am and i am a huge fan of the transformers the animated motion picture was by far my favorite alot of the cartoons now pale in comparison the the quality of the movie i just wish that your company would get this great classic back in stock i would sure be hot to get a copy of it hail to optimus prime label the sweetness of an acomplished writer the sting of satire a hive for the honey bee is an excellent book and will bring pleasure to all ages combining satire and a genuine love of life the novel explores the life of the honey bee in fine detail without boring us with unnecessary technicalities the sort of novel which ought to be a treasured part of your bookshelf label worthless kills the signal so much the reciever doesn t even see it it s about a shade of pink on the other side i am hooking this up to a ps3 and dvr to a jbl reciever everything works well with just the stright through calbes but no matter what you do with a optical signal it chokes all the time best of to convert to digital coaxal cable or worst off to buy a new reciever label crap out one of the worst movies i ve seen in a long while tracy jordan is not funny just infantile and one of the worst actors currently on the big screen bruce willis must have had one more movie in his contract cause i just can t see why he would willingly agree to do this film i didn t buy this film from amazon i did watch it on hbo really really really sucks label bu-ray review one of if not the worst movies i ve ever seen what the hell happened here how could anyone like this movie label i cannot believe that bruce willis would stoop so low this movie was a huge disappointment to me i trust bruce willis to deliver entertaining family action fun but never again i cannot believe that he took this script yech if you like obscene good-ol boy trash you might like this one but not with your kids and not me shame on you bruce willis for disappointing your fan base label please do not spend money on this movie it sucks trust me i never write reviews but i saw this movie the other day and it s that bad that i had to come on here and write this they tried to make a lot of scenes funny but it wasn t it was just annoying because of how hard they were trying to make it that way alot of the jokes made no sense to plz rent it if anything hope this helps label cop out save your money this is a bad movie the acting is poor and the story is stupid not well produce as well written label the brat pack it is the best collection i purchased because of the movies and the music compact disc that comes included thank you raul label quite simply a pointless re-release of the high school reunion box set although this box set features an exclusive s music cd all three films come in a anamorphic widescreen presentation with the choice of dolby digital or dts audio the dvds also include a theatrical trailer for each film and a interactive menu for each film in other words they re all barebones discs and this box set is a pointless re-release label good set if you don t already own the films the infamous double-dip i previously didn t own these waiting for some features which this set definitely has my advice is that if you already own them it s not worth it if you don t buying them all together in this set is a good deal my only complaint would be the size of the case it s too tall to fit on my shelve but besides that i ve got nothing bad to say label weird science pretty in pink should have been bundled with this set not weird science stick to the theme people weird science would have been more appropriately-bundled with a film such as zapped also where are all the special features label excellent for lyrics but lacking in music information this is an amazing book as far as teaching you one of the fundamental aspects of song writing goes which is giving the song proper structure it teaches song structure from strictly a lyricist s point of view however such as verse chorus structures or verse bridge etc the book is worth its weight in gold for this info alone but it lacks any information on how to write the music for the song but nevertheless it has some greeaattt ideas buy it for its really cool ideas on how to write song lyrics but don t look for music composition in it one of the great ideas it has though is to write lyrics while listening to one of your favorite song s music conversely you could write the music for your song s lyrics by arranging your music to one of your favorite song s lyrics do you see what i m saying this really really works to give you an awesome song structure label shattered handle in a sealed box stopped at macy s to take a look at this the sales clerk opened a sealed box to reveal a shattered handle buyer beware seems awful compared to other pressure cookers the design of the large handle on this one seems to be inherently easy to break also note that a quart cooker is too small for most uses remember you can only fill half-way with soup and a piece of meat cannot extend higher than the height of the cooker check out the presto quart that costs about less and includes excellent customer service just my cents label arrived with broken handle and made in china my quart fagor duo arrived today on halloween i opened the outer amazon box to retrieve the inner fagor box and i immediately hear stuff sliding around inside i opened the box up and the lower handle is broken off and little grainy pieces of plastic are everywhere in the bottom of the box i will be returning this item for sure for a refund the box does say made in china i would not trust the websites that say it is made in spain label arrived with handles and valve damaged arrived via ups in intact outer carton factory fagor carton had one small dent in it on removing the cooker the lid and pot handles were broken almost as if someone had taken a hammer to them shattered would be a better term the pressure valve also was chipped called fagor and they acted as if this had never happened before even though multiple other one star evaluations mention the same problem the item was unusable and i sent it back and got a refund in view of this experience i bought another brand of qt pressure cooker stainless manttra pressure settings and cheaper and it works great label poor quality lousy nonexistent customer service the first fagor duo i purchased in was and still is great no problems but in feb i bought another duo from macy s and needed to return it because lid wouldn t lock into place the replacement duo has had lid-locking trouble as well followed by when months new the screw holding the handle onto the pot continually getting loose but becoming stripped so that the pot handle cannot be repaired with my repeated calls and emails to fagor customer service to get the pot repaired or replaced i was discouraged by their slow and impersonal response if they replied at all it was with a cryptic one-line instruction and web-link to watch their long and complicated video on how to repair the pot myself finally gave up and returned the pot to store for a refund label fagor pressure cooker i ve used the pressure cooker several times since receiving it it reaches the pressure point quickly cooks great and easy cleanup label way too simple the majority of the information in this book is pretty basic and is already covered in any basic unix text anyone who doesn t know most of what is in the first half of the book has no business having root access to begin with seriously if you don t know how to use cp ls or man commands all discussed in the book you aren t ready to be a unix sysadmin the bottom line is that if you have been a sysadmin for more than two months this book isn t much use i guess all the good stuff is discussed in the advanced system administrators guide but i was so disappointed in this book that i won t bother getting it label fall apart my son wanted this toy and when he received it he was unable to play with it it falls apart at the slightest touch i have tried to find a way to super glue to no avail i would stongly recommend not buying this way to much aggravation for parent and child alike label could have been better whilst i concede the mr leckie s prose style is easily-paced and therefore hannibal is the kind of book you could probably read in a single afternoon all this book really achieves is to prove you cannot write a fictional biography of one of history s most captivating figures in a mere pages i had high hopes because a full third of those pages dealt with hannibal s boyhood where the author is at full license to use his imagination given the lack of historical detail for hannibal but it almost as though mr leckie gets bored and rushes through the end in order to begin writing scipio historical inaccuracies aside the life of hannibal deserves a better account than the author has attempted and i think it is safe to say that the definitive fictional biography of hannibal has yet to be written if you like historical fiction set in the roman period buy it if not don t label old but good it was fun if you use to play online these were available for free back when was fun to play again label old video the box came in good shape but the video when played has that wiggly stripe on the top of the picture the one you get when the video is old and played too much thsi video was supposed to be in excellent condition definitely not better than ok condition label beautiful it is beautiful a little smaller than i thought but no problem the pendant is very well done very delicate i gave it to my mother and she loved it label great gift for mom i purchased this loving family necklace for my mom for mother s day they come with all different size families and really send a strong caring message she cried label my son loves this i bought this for my yr old son who says he wants to be a paleontologist when he grows up i love that it was not necessarily easy to uncover the bones he did it little by little over several days yes it was messy that didn t bother us easy clean up the bones were flexible so you didn t have to worry about breaking them as you uncovered them we also used a little chisel to help as someone else had noted we are just putting it together today so i can t yet vouch for how well it will stay together taking other s comments into consideration though label great beginner book at good price i am a classic asp developer the company that i work for has recently decided to pursue net for future web development this was the first book that i read in order to get a grasp of the changes from classic asp to asp net i have to say that this book was a great introduction to a lot of the new features of asp net there are a few things i would like to point out when considering buying this book this is a beginner book no advanced topics good coverage of the different types of controls available in net quick and easy read only basic coverage of ado net source code available as a download assumes that you have vs net although i used asp net web matrix there were some typos but nothing ridiculous overall i like this book good price for a good book label good quick book full of examples pros the book really gets you to the code quickly which is what i like the book features code in both vb net and c francis b gallagher from catonsville review incorrectly mentions that it does not contain code from both the lang the author mentions on pg that due to space constraints he will list only one lang or the other the other code is available on the website cons i did not give it stars because it assumes that you have already worked on asp before and keeps making annoying comparisons throughout the text label outdated this book is outdated and would have been fine a decade ago net is version now a good bit has changed label sloppy editing i bought this book recently to learn asp net and feel i have mainly wasted my money in the main the author simply has not put himself into the place of the newbie he aims the book at rather than give opinions let me quote specific examples from an early chapter listing gives code to be added to the page load method when you try to run it it doesn t work you find out pages later that you should have added a group of using statements it would have been easy to add these lines to the snippet or at least give a forward reference to them in the same snippet you re invited to open a database named pubs publications the following snippets perform various functions on this database but this is not a standard database and you re given no details of how it s put together so you can mock up your own in access or whatever i advise against this book label works poorly and very poor documentation don t waste your money on this poorly made poor documentation device if you need technical support you are connected with india support line good luck trying to understand what they are saying after they read their script to say how sorry they are and then after speaking to different technical support staff the made in china hawking still fails to work properly with mac computer complete waste of money label not worth the trouble i work in it and i find this piece of equipment to be ridiculously complicated i think eventually it is possible to make it work correctly but there are many many things you can do wrong in trying to set it up my first one worked well for a few weeks but then started giving only an intermittent signal tech support talked me through about troubleshooting steps over calls and finally had me send it back it took weeks to get an rma and then only after i called them to say what s up i sent it back and again two weeks before i called again and they sent one overnight i guess they don t do anything unless you complain this new one seems to work fine except i can t get it to successfully extend an encrypted network of any level encryption an unsecured network extends very well but who wants to leave their network open so it s back to tech support to see if they can explain what i m doing wrong label good product worked easily easily connected to the wireless link with the software if you want a stronger link long distance between router would recommend getting an additional antenna label worked as advertised my purpose for buying this range extender was to allow connection to home network from outside of the home it works well and allows use of handheld netbook and laptop computers from distances of to feet outside of the home it also allowed me to connect a security camera to the home network that i had been unable to use prior to this purchase it actually acts as a new hotspot well worth the money and very easy to setup i would recommend it to anyone label hawking is useless can access the hawking hwreg1 wireless g range extender very well from laptops and a ps3 on the otherhand it does not allow internet access therefore it is a brick that serves no purpose might could use it for a doorstop it extended the range of what could not be done already called support they had no clue of what to do therefore i cannot recommend this product it does not work and tech support is non-existent rather i would suggest staying away from it it is the first product that i have bought that was completely useless label didn t work box said it was simple to install and set up i beg to differ it didn t work and offshore tech support was useless as i couldn t understand the tech sent it back for refund label not very functional like many of the other posters the toy bag does not stick to our bathroom wall this is very frustrating because when it is full of toys and it falls off the wall it makes a loud noise and a big mess it falls off the wall even when it is empty which is still annoying because it should stay on the wall the other issue i had was the blue dye on the fabric bled onto many of the soft plastic toys or sponges label one side won t stick to my walls decent size cubby to hold toys in the bath but one side doesn t seem to want to stick to the walls label doesn t stay stuck this product does not stay stuck to our bathtub walls it is constantly falling and it s very frustrating i would not recommend this product to anyone label disappointed the suction cups won t stick to the formica around our tub i thought maybe they would stick if we had tile but i see that others with tile tub surrounds can t get it to stick either now that i think about it suction cups like this always fall off of our fiberglass shower glass storm door too so i guess i should have known better than to get a suction cup bath toy holder this fisher price corner bath cubby is a waste of money i m going to try the kidco storage caddy instead i wish i had gotten it in the first place i suggest you do the same label it was boring i ll make this short if you read the books this one was based on well you know what s going to happen and it sucks all the anticipation of it i m sorry to say this but i like not knowing the ending because then anything can happen knowing what s going to happen is seriously boring and sucky label nice little appliance very nice inexpensive yogurt maker the only problem i had at first was that the yogurt wasn t thick enough but i found that if i leave it on for about hours it is good i also put the cooled yogurt in a coffee filter to strain out more of the liquid this makes it much better when adding berries and such it stays thick label carefree yogurt maker the salton ym9 yogurt maker is compact easy to use and clean i find it works best and fastest if commercial yogurt with active cultures such as dannon plain is used as the starter and regular milk rather than dry is used for the base the final product is sweet and creamy despite warnings that homemade yogurt cannot rival the texture and consistency of commercial yogurt not so in my case this was a great buy that i m very pleased with note that you ll need a candy thermometer or food thermometer that reads temperatures as low as degrees and as high as degrees label cheap and easy to make yogurt i used to teach intermediate level microbiology in college and learned how to make yogurt from milk powdered milk and a spoonful of live yogurt for starting culture in addition i m a big fan of brown cow cream top yogurt and they are expensive at for oz tub now i have found a way to make my very own cream top yogurt using this yogurt maker i heat non-homogenized whole milk with powdered milk until warm and add cup of commercial yogurt after hours of incubation i got a tub full of nice firm yogurt that was not tart nor too sour after adding splenda and some dried fruit i have a pick me up snack for any time in the day label wonderful product it really does make yogurt my wife has been trying to make yogurt for quite some time she has tried the oven technique careful temperature monitoring and various other book-suggested methods i bought her this one just as another method to tryout it really works will the yogurt look like or have the same type of consistency as store bought yogurt no but it comes pretty close to it i read some of the reviews saying that it does not make yogurt like you can buy in the store to that i say you will be enjoying natural yogurt with more nutrition probiotic store-bought yogurt actually defeats the whole purpose of eating yogurt with your meal you can make store-bought like consistancy if you incorporate little bit of pectine or soluble fibre like agar agar powder if you don t like the excess water in home made yogurt it is better to strain the water out with a cheese cloth in that case you don t have to add extra powder milk label is this made of gold silver i was planning on getting this but the price is way way too much retail value for this item is there are other yogurt makers much cheaper this item has been discontinued usually when a small kitchen appliance is discontinued it goes on clearance it is important to note that this item does not churn ice cream and it does not churn or freeze yogurt this item merely heats to the proper temperature for making yogurt the sellers who are selling this item are clearly unethical as anyone can see by the price this is a yogurt maker and should be priced as such someone needs to get real and fix the price issue here amazon should not allow this sort of price gouging label too small useless so small it holds just a quart of milk cups the milk has to be boiled it doesn t do it it just keeps the milk warm you can make yogurt yourself without it you can use container with lid to keep the milk warm you don t need to pay money to keep the milk warm label low-cost delicious and easy-to-make yogurt i got the salton ym9 yogurt maker for christmas of so i ve had a full year to really test the machine and hone my yogurt-making skills the salton yogurt maker is a no-frills budget appliance it is not one of those fancy gourmet euro-cuisine or donvier makers which come with individual-sized glass jars and cost twice as much as the salton no the salton ym9 is a plastic plug-in model and it does the job fine i wanted to make my own yogurt because store-bought yogurt is costly and if you read most ingredient labels is often made with high-fructose corn syrup i prefer the quart container because i make a big batch of plain yogurt once a week and then add pure d frozen fruit and splenda to flavor it as i desire it s a healthful breakfast food or snack i highly recommend this item label ok machine but not what i expected i bought two of this item because people said that a quart mason jar fit inside it perfectly unfortunately since those reviews were written the design must have changed because quart sized mason jars do not fit the yogurt makers that were delivered to me the glass jars are too narrow and too tall to work well with it now unless i can find a short fat quart jar i am stuck with the plastic liner that came with the set very disappointed label priced right easy to use and the yogurt taste is wonderful this has got to be the best buy of the year i love kitchen toys and this one is my favorite its so easy to use and the benefits of making homemade yogurt without additives adding to the healthy choices of good eating the salton ym9 yogurt maker should be your next purchase it deserves more than a star rating label yogurt supreme the salton ym9 is easy to use the explicit directions in the manual are simple to follow the yogurt produced is excellent the plastic scoop spoon that comes with the ym9 is unnecessary i like the quart size rather than hassling with several small containers cleanup is a breeze and the ym9 is an attractive appliance make sure you have a candy thermometer as you will be preheating milk and mixing starter only after the milk has dropped to the right temperature note to salton dump the spoon and include thermometer the ym9 is an inexpensive easy to use effective product enjoy label awesome i have made almond milk yogurt using both apple and honey sweeteners cashew milk yogurt sprouted soy bean yogurt and sunflower yogurt which i made into cheese the thing is totally versatile i had to buy a non-dairy starter but the people at custom probiotics made that simple too easy to use easy to clean the yogurts i have made have fermented hours with no problems altogether a great buy label makes great yogurt this little yogurt maker delivers great yogurt although i would have preferred one with an automatic shutoff well worth the money though i highly recommend it label love it this kit really helped me the nipple butter is way better than any lanolin cream and i m sure it s much healthier too i also love the boobit tubes although i would love them more if they stayed cold longer i am a bit lazy to use the compress too often but it really does make a difference tea is suprisingly yummy it s summertime at the moment in southern california so i made a big piture of iced tea with it yum label i love this book i read this book with my year old boy and my year old daughter and they loved it the storyline appeals to both boys and girls my daughter loved the cohesiveness of the girls in the story and my son loves the silliness factor this is such a great childrens book reaching out to them on their level i would highly recommend this book and cannot wait for the next installment label folding is pathetic you fold this up and unless you have the case with you you have dangling posts about long each going every which way i am going to have to look for a product that folds into itself telescope style far far more practical label user you did not mention the extend in inches this cane can be adjusted i ll spend a couple more dollars and buy the carex adjustable cane instead label i dig roman numerals and jewelry so buying this little ring was a no-brainer it came quickly and appears just as it s pic shows fits a lil snug for the size listed but not uncomfortably a good buy for the price if you re looking for a simple ring with features it lists i say it s a piece label terrible this documentary was absolutely awful it follows a young and pretentious couple as they try to eat healthy on food stamps basically they aren t willing to change their diet at all everything has to be fresh adn organic and they still try to buy the same expensive products they always have plus where are they shopping it looks like a whole foods or central market not somewhere people on food stamps would actually be able to afford they constantly complain about how they aren t full and they can t afford desert they even have friends over for dinner as if you can afford to feed your friends when you can t even afford to feed yourslef i watched this with a group of people liberals and conservatives and everyone equally hated it i guess any idiot can make a documentary these days and call it factual don t waste your time label leaded glass for wine i am sure that leaded glass for drinking has been shown to be very liable to result in lead in the beverage the longer it holds the beverage the more lead disolves i believe these glasses are not fit for human use joseph crilly label not sturdy enough i have very fine shoulder length hair and yet i cannot go a full day without these breaking especially if i lie down not worth the money unless they are to be used for very small bunches of hair or children s hair label tough crystal i hope i got these glasses for a couple whose wine glasses are constantly getting broken they previously got the schott-zweisel forte titanium wine glasses cabernet merlot and these have been broken it is too soon to tell if this reinforced crystal will last any better but they are very nice glasses they are good size give the requisite chime upon clinking glasses and are very good-looking label not at all like the riedel bordeaux glasses not at all what i thought the reviews made this sound like the reidel bordeaux glasses but these hold maybe half the wine are much smaller in volume don t have much of a balloon shape very disappointed don t get these if your goal is to replicate the reidel label a don t learn solaris book i can t see how a book like this gets published but there is no other solaris book so many people are stuck with it examples are lame and only touches the surface sun educational services has excellent books that you get with the course about days that s better why don t they publish that instead label what christmas spurs means to me i love the book because at the time i read it a girl i new was suffering from luekiemia just like jimmy i read it my sixth grade year and every time i see her i think of the book it was very meaningful to me i hope that it is a meaningful to you thank you for reading hope you like the book label quilling rocks this is a great book to add to your quilling book library i teach quilling at a college and a few assistant living places and i find that the designs offered in this book are great for single class projects lots of great ideas and inspiration for my students and i label waste of money i am a huge easterbrook fan especially of this tmq column on espn i figured this book would be interesting and on similar lines but i was greatly disappointed with it just a bunch of lines of text with pictures in between absolutely do not waste your money on this label great portable nailer honestly a great finish nailer to use it has lots of power and is really easy to handle with no air hose and compressor if anyone is interested in this finish nailer i would highly recommened it i have both the bostitch and a dewalt finish nailers and they don t compare to this volt dewalt model one down side of the nailer can be the weight which is a little over eight pounds but you seem to get use to it i got mine brand new at lowes for and it came in a pack with the volt dewalt circular saw label not as described this sword is advertised to have a brass guard when in fact it is only a brass color that is cheaply dipped over some type of metal we understand now why it was priced as low as it is as it is a cheap wall hanger that should be hidden in a dark area of your room will i buy from this seller again likely not label chilean indian poetry john bierhorst the translator of this volume is a translator whose work i trust in this bi and tri-lingual text he has justified my confidence in him the poets translated in the volume have a varied amount of indian-ness some speak the indian language of the group with which they identify some do not the poems themselves range from poems that show a non-spanish aesthetic to those that are openly spanish in some sense for example a poem by jaime luis huenun is titled after reading so much cesar vallejo and three poems of graciela huinao remind me of the sparseness of haiku my favorite of the poets in elicura chihuailaf whose poems center around blue a color with strong ties to the indian culture these poems are perhaps the most indian but the poems are universal in the depiction of humanity and its relationship to the rest of nature while being accessible and particular in terms of images these poems are well worth your time label royal hunt best album by far este disco lo compr de casualidad compr paradox y jam s lo he escuchado tuve una corazonada y fue totalmente un acierto esta banda de gran profundidad musical se maneja a sus anchas y de que forma son muy pocas las bandas que pueden tocar tan bien en directo definitivamente son sensacionales i got this cd by pure casualty i buyed paradox and honestly i have never heard it but i got a premonition that this band is really good the players well docted in classical music play and how they do it only the superbands can perform in this way live were few tricks are allowed label great new rts definitly a must for rts fans hey it just released and there are players around the world playing so there gonna find the exploits just hopefully ea will not get lazy early on like past rts games and keep the patches comming label breadth but not depth the book was a good broad overview of what to consider when creating a portfolio however it did not delve deeply into details instead it provides other sources one should view for more info still a helpful book label this thriller didn t thrill me i m glad deviant ways wasn t the first book by chris mooney that i read or it probably would have been the last deviant ways has an interesting although not very original plot and it does have its moments of excitement however the characters never came to life for me and i found i gave up on caring what happened to them further the bad guy seriously lacked credibility it came to a point that i found myself skimming through the last third of the book and the only real thrill i got from deviant ways was when i came to its end do yourself a favor and skip this book but do read remembering sarah by mooney label disappointed i have loved all of john irving s other books i was excited to read this one but i was quite disappointed the storytelling and the plot are usual irving style but ruth s the main character relationship with hannah as well her lovers are surprisingly superficial and unbelievable irving s usual ironic humor is missing and there doesn t seem to be anything taking it s place label at least i bought it in a sale john irving is a very talented storyteller which is why i bought a widow for one year however i couldn t even finish in italics this book i became annoyed early on when irving describes eddie as carrying a heavy duffel bag and a lighter smaller suitcase unfortunately he does this about ten in italics times in as many pages after the third time i was mentally screaming enough already i get the picture luggage is okay now irving s constant use of italics is also extremely in italics helpful i couldn t have possibly worked out the nuances of the conversation for myself not combined with the thin and dreary plot this work is not exactly a page turner more of a page churner label a major disappointment from one of my favourite authors although this book starts off quite promisingly and quite thrillingly i found it quickly descended into a contrived and finally uninteresting story the plot twists were unbelievable and the characters motivations were at times ridiculous unfortunately after the last two superb books a prayer for owen meany and a son of the circus this was a major disappointment label a widow for one year this has to be the most boring novel i have read in fact once i put it down i found that it is virtually impossible to pick it up again however since i bought the book i picked it up again at about page only to put it down again at page i doubt if i ll ever start again the book stinks label a disappointment i love john irving he is a funny quirky and captivating writer who often hits me right in the centre of my heart that s the problem with this book its as if he is trying to be quirky that he knows that is his hallmark instead his characters come of seeming flawed or pathetic the book started out where a tragedy is announced and i was immediately pulled into the novel and ready for some heartwrenching times instead as the book progressed i had trouble reading it becuase it seemed like he was just trying to hard or something if you read prayer for owen meany then son of the circus then you read this book you are in for a big disappointment label please don t bother with this one a widow for one year was my first john irving book and it might be my last while i thought the plot was interesting at first it quickly went downhill from there irving cluttered up the novel with extempraneous details and subplots that did nothing to help me to the end if anything they were deterrents along the way i didn t love or even like any of the characters and hannah was a nightmare i found myself wondering why ruth or anyone would ever be friends with her it was such an effort to finish the book that i vow never to force myself to read such drivel again the only thing that i looked forward to in this book was finishing it so i could start a new one by a different author but i hear a prayer for owen meany is well worth the read however the next irving book i pick up will be from the library as i can t bear to spend more money on anything that has the slightest chance of being so mundane label a widow for one year a waste of one month when people ask me whose books i enjoy reading the name john irving is always first off my lips ever since a friend in college recommended garp i have been hooked by his engaging style and fascinating stories until now this book bored me to tears i did not care in the least for ruth cole the main focus of the book or any of the other drab people we meet along this sad journey if this is the only john irving book you have read and you didn t like it don t do yourself a disservice please buy and savor his previous fine novels i will be first in line for his next tome but as for this one it is a sad disappointment sorry john label new irving fan having just read two of john irvings books cider house rules i am new to the phenomenon of mr irving however i must agree with his most ardent fans he is a wonderful storyteller a novel that will totally submege you into the world of its characters even the weakest character is so well developed that you love him more for his weaknesses also my edition had an interview with the author at the end of the book it was so enlightening read it only after you finish i have now decided that my next two irving books will be garp and prayer for owen meaney both these novels have been tranformed to the big screen having seen cider house on the big screen i saw all that was missing i am looking forward to reading these two and rediscovering the world according to irving label i knew it wouldn t be owen meany and was still disappointed john irving seemed to be presenting his story of ruth cole as if from a great distance his narrative seemed often to be building up to something as if it were all deep background that never happened astounding coincidences aside the narrative was so sparse so clinical and pretty crude that it was really difficult to relate to any of the characters for example it was hard to imagine why ruth cole and hannah were best friends as they acted like they only hurt and annoyed each other they didn t seem to understand or to comfort each other it was as if irving said they were best friends so they were but there was no reason to believe i did like the narrative devices that irving used including ruth s postcards and journals as a chapter and one of her short stories it enriched what was otherwise a sparse narrative in all the first section was the most compelling the rest not so much label dull and lifeless after the first pages mr irving starts off strong with interesting well drawn characters however after the first section there is nothing that s either interesting compelling or particularly well written it s my guess that mr irving started a pretty good novel and either to explain or excuse his purient interest in prostitutes tried to steer his good opening into a trite story about and unlikeable writer and her purient interest in prostitutes i guess if nothing else this book helped mr irving explain to his wife and the irs why he needed to hang out in amsterdam s red light district label irvings best ever john irving continually amazes me as in all his books i was not bored for one page no one can create characters the way irving can his best ever label this was the same writer who gave us garp i can t believe it garp was such a masterpiece and this was such drivel disappointing label the scenarios seemed contrived uninteresting characters as this was my first irving book and i had heard such great things about his writing i expected to sit back and be thoroughly entertained no such luck i was relatively bored by ruth as a main character her raucus friend hannah seemed more interesting and big deal about the older woman yr old boy story shocking not really if the story was about eddie s life after this love affair it would have been much more colorful not much room in this book for titilation either lest a murder get in the way yawn drawbacks boring and slightly interesting from chapter to chapter positives at least there was some resolution of conflicts or hint at it loved the ending clever final dialogue label such a disappointment it s hard to believe this is the same author who wrote the extraordinary cider house rules it felt to me like one long in irving fashion rebuttal letter to his critics this book was transparently irving s forum for justifying through character ruth his style and choices in past works if you read the book you ll understand yes i believe a man can write from a woman s viewpoint no i don t believe irving was able to pull it off in widow the book read like a sidney sheldon novel the only difference is that so far it s not embarrassing to read a john irving book on the bus the story was entirely predictable the writing simplistic and even dumbed-down and the cliches ran rampant i was expecting something more heady from one of my favorite american authors label not my type i picked up this book based on numerous good reviews on the internet plus john irving is a renowned writer however i couldn t bring myself to continue reading past page the characters are a bit too weird for me i believe this is my first last john irving s book label long winded and disappointing i have been an avid irving fan since i was in jr high i anticipate all his new arrivals with tingles i am sure that i will laugh and cry this time i did part was great i was curious about part it was all i could to finish it why it totally faltered and was dull and predictable i am afraid the creator of my all time favorite character has let me down next time i buy paperback and read the reviews label dog-do sophomoric high school boy stuff i detested this book i read it for my book club and threw it away in disgust many of us in the club felt the same way trust me there will be a bonfire when we talk about this book how can someone write that many pages about breasts and cashmere sweaters and how jeans fit come on there s much more to life and people than that the characters had no depth no souls and i had no desire to know them as people at a cocktail party if i d met someone like any of them i would have moved on i prefer real books label of the most memorable books of the past years i read for those who do like real stories with real people with real passion talent happiness and all the bad things which can happen to all of us to thom who like people out of the ordinary those who are not perfect but still live a valuable life for those who appreciate people who make an impact and inspire others those who like high quality literature label irving does it again author comes up with new ideas that keep his works exciting and new he is one of the most creative writers i ve read and weaves a tale that can grab the reader s heart every time label a widow for pages this is not irving s finest work but the great thing about irving is that even when it s not great literature it s usually still a good read the first last act it s divided into three acts are fabulous the middle lulls but just when i was about to give up on it it became fascinating again i give it four stars for a star st rd act and a star nd act label my wife was injured by the glass we received these glasses as a wedding gift through our registry when washing the glasses for the first time my wife cut her finger on a mm sharp spur defect protruding from the bottom inside surface of the glass almost invisible on casual inspection but quite nasty to be cut by label a sad excuse for a study guide this book is the worst study guide i have ever purchased for that matter it is the worst book i have ever purchased for a number of reasons first the book is full of typographical errors improperly spaced sentences and poor grammar second the book is printed on cheap paper and poor quality ink the book reminds me of an old dimestore novel with the cheap grungy feel to it third the quality of the review material is horrible and is presented in an almost unreadable manner i aced the praxis test this book was supposed to help with and did not see any benefit from reading or purchasing this book please save your money and buy another study guide unfortunately i am not sure the others are any better or even available label no quality control when i received the boat for christmas we were very excited mom had even thought to get an extra battery unfortunately when the seal was broken and the contents reviewed it was found that there was no antennae for the remote control the slot was empty where it belonged there were no instructions none and the decals were all crushed up in one corner of the box just for the heck of it i tried to see if it would work without an antennae but it was dead as a doornail without it amazon accepted it back only option allowed was to return for refund however may be stuck with the extra battery what a disappointment very poor quality control the boat was very cheaply made and the hinge to open the battery door felt very flimsy and had to be pried open i certainly will not but from these people again recommend look for a higher end supplier label broke after week this toy was fantastic fun for one week my year old son loved it and was surprisingly good at controlling the boat he did not crash it once and it zoomed around in our pond giving several hours of fun during the week we had it in the summer however it stopped working on the th day was it observing the sabbath and despite replacing the battery pack it just would not work again i tried contacting the company and asking for a replacement or a refund but they ignored me i would not buy this boat again or deal with this company a big fat waste of label great but no antenna i bought not but of these for my daughters to play with on our vacation easy set up and they are sturdy was pleased until we got them in the water after going about feet the controls no longer worked it seems that there must be an antenna problem since the boat works great up close but not at range if this got fixed i would highly recommend the product but feet isn t that great a distance maybe i missed attaching another antenna has anyone else had this problem label do not order from trendy nation my product has not arrived order was supposedly shipped a month ago seller will not return emails have filed a claim and i hope amazon will correct very disappointed label another great book from kay hooper i ve read a number of kay hooper s books and this one is just as great as every other one i ve read it s got the same elements are the other works that i loved the romance the suspense the action et cetera once i started reading i couldn t put it down i read the whole book in less than hours i definitely recommend this book to anyone who has ever read anything else that kay hooper has written label amazing i got his box for a christmas gift and was amazed it came with the ten complete dvds and a guide though not really that helpful introducing new faces camille bidan fa yuiry emma sheen four murasame jerid messa and paptimus scirocco and old classics amuro ray char quattro bajeena aznable kai hyato and katz the box art was really nice so i felt like putting it on my wall it also comes with mini figures of the zeta gundam gundam mkii the o nemo hyaku shiki asshimar gabthley messala palace athene hizack and more and for a good finisher it comes with a poster of the major zeta gundam mobile suits if you like newtypes cyber-newtypes giant robo and one gerat piece of gundam history get this set label inoperative it arrived broken i returned it and i still haven t received a refund i will not order any reconditioned tools through amazon com label don t waste your time and money i ve had good luck in the past with reconditioned products half the power air tools i use were purchased reconditioned refurbished but this nailer is not to be trusted the first one wouldn t fire a single nail no pressure through the piston the replacement that amazon provided me at no cost to me at all thank you amazon fired one single nail then started blowing by exactly like the first one i know it s not my equipment i had to use a rental dewalt nailer for the past week while trying to sort this out and it worked flawlessly every day despite looking exactly like what you d expect a rental nailer to look like that is beat to hell don t be afraid to buy reconditioned just stay as far away from this nailer as you possibly can a good start would be to not buy it in the first place label disappointed when i recieved this nailer i hooked it up and tested it and it worked after a few tries but when i got on the roof to shingle with it it never shot a nail label great buy this is a great deal i recieved the gun in almost brand new condition fired off perfectly put nails through a x at psi i have a gallon compressor and it didn t kick on until about nails i highly recommend this gun factory-reconditioned bostitch u rn46 inch to inch coil roofing nailer label very good album this album is very unique and full of folklore yet easy to listen and relax to the seller also delivered within the specified time promised label second step in cdma design and opt if you know the basics of any cdma system is cdma etc this book is going to be very useful to understand the basic design and opt concepts related to umts but if you are not familiar with dsss basics you may get lost in the first chapters label never got product odd because i got one product from seller but not another and was very satisfied i ordered at the same time and the sent the first package and the second package never came and was delivered but returned for inadequate address label good for adults bad for kids my daughter and i looked over this and the other two books by dr dyer and found them to be totally useless most of the ideas in the books are things either totally inapplicable to children beyond what a child can do or understand or so basic a child already knows it many of the suggestions are great for adults to be reminded of though label inspirational this book is terrific i love it and my year-old daughter loves it she has struggled with some grief issues and some self-esteem issues and this book makes her smile every time we read it she has even asked if we can get more books like that i am so pleased to have her read positive things about herself and have a chance to think about why she herself is so special thank you dr dyer label great product have been looking for eyebrow shaper for long finally found it it so easy to use but u have to be careful so that it doesn t cut it other than that its a great product label really a big letdown i too feel i must chime in and express my disappointment in this book the subject matter is fascinating i ve been interested in end times prophecy for quite some time after hearing kathleen on art bell s show i ordered the book eagerly there were some major delays with the book s arrival but that s another matter the writing is of poor quality the book s production values seem to be not quite up to par the fact that so much of the book was based on the lueken work was the most shocking part of it all the supply list in the back of the book smacked of hucksterism i too am sorry i bought this book and urge those who are interested in this sort of material to look elsewhere starting with father malachi martin s books fr martin s books will stand the test of time this book will not label wish i could give it more stars this book touched my heart and changed my life i can t thank the author enough for taking chances like this to wake people like me up label you really should buy this book kathleen keating did an awesome job in tying together the various sources on prophecy and political intrigue before i read the book i had heard ms keating on the radio i did my own looking into the subject matter she had spoken about i can tell you that she is absolutely credible the book is interesting but moreover will prove an invaluable survival tool in the probable future we are racing toward label what a crock i quote another reader s review anyone who would believe this garbage is either naive or stupid faith is one thing but being a complete sheep is another this woman s obvious intention is to serve her own agenda and make a buck and you paranoid bible thumpers let her get away with it this is a woman who sells banner ad space on her website hello investigative journalist my try wallet reaver label shoddy research i had the displeasure of reading this book in it s entirety this week there wasn t any new information here at all the research consists of stories that can be found on any conspiracy web site on the internet saying that i m not impressed is about the nicest thing i can say this book is a major disappointment the same information can be found anywhere on the internet and requires no special research some of the information should be viewed with a very discerning eye very disappointing label unimpressive on several levels that pretty much sums it up i ve seen this stuff on the web this appears to just be a rehash without anything new and notable the line about packing the china which another reviewer picked up on was hilarious this just strikes me as a quick-and-dirty effort more attention being paid to getting it out and making money off it than to actual content and information again very unimpressive but hey that s what reviews are all about right like someone else said save your money label rip off this poster was horrible i could have had my yr old son draw me a better one it was very disappointing you should be ashamed of selling such a bad product i wish i could have given you a zero label a weak effort i agree this book would not have been published if wambaugh didn t already have a good track record the plot is a variation on body heat but the outcome is telegraphed so early that the only fun was seeing how the details would vary he also seemed to be emulating bonfire of the vanities in early chapters but without success some of the dialog made me wince label folding cane like the ease of use and folding the carry case is a joke it is not that easy to place the cane in the case i do wish it came with a wrist strap attached the design color is attractive would recommend label mystery entwined with history a suspenseful humerous teen time travel adventure mary cunningham s novel cynthia s attic the missing locket tells the story of two twelve-year-old girls cynthia and gus best friends who embark on a startling supernatural adventure as a magical trunk in cynthia s attic propels them fifty years into the past where they encounter their grandmothers when they were twelve year old best friends core values of family friendship loyalty and love pervade this rapid fire page turning tale as cynthia and gus struggle to unravel dark mysteries entwining their family s present and past the tension is parlayed with humor creating a perfect mix to enthrall both teen and adult readers alike i am an adult reader and writer who loved this book and am now enthusiastically sharing it with my daughters ages fifteen and eleven i look forward to reading more by this exceptional author mary cunningham mitch lits author of a little of your time and dream travelers label so much better this product is far and away the most durable cover it is plenty long enough and fits great it has great anchoring so the wind doesn t come underneath it and blow away worth the money definitely label motorola fr60 this is a decent way radio pros works wellgood sound qualitysturdy dropped mine several times and they still work great they will last had mine for probably over years cons on the bulky sidea bit expensiveshorter rangebottom line i was at target today and saw motorola s radio don t remember what it is but it has a mile range is tiny and was only i would go with something more along those lines the fr60 is a good radio but you can get better for cheaper label very good itam usually i wanted to have item so nearly i bought it in the amazon finally reactor stove system delived to me and today i use to heat water in the m t very very good i m saticefied of msr recommend item for people to love m t or to enjoy varity life label functional few chips and scratches in wood did not want to return because i needed it immediately will cover flaws with stain label they re not from england just to clear something up that was mentioned by another review the tender idols are not from england they are from atlanta georgia anyway that s not really the issue the tenders idols have been around for a while check out the haggered face of the guitarist he looks like john lennon after yoko had sucked the life out of him and distressor is their third album it s also their best possibly because they have themselves a fairly new and extremely talented bassist in joe jones distressor is a mix of everything associated with brit pop with a little punk and heavy rock thrown in for good measure it s nothing very innovative or particularly new but it s a very well produced album that is the kind of cd i like to listen to when i write they re a solid band who deserve to start getting some recognition soon label garage beat i did not think any of this collection was worth the listen disappointed as have heard some gems from that era but this copy did not have any for my taste label baby s buddy my daughter loves to stare at her pooh toy i put this on the changing table and she just looks and looks at it while i am changing her i take it with me in the car and set it where she can see it boy it attracts her attention she is still too little to hold it but i am sure that once she is grasping things this will be one of the first toys she holds label taunt rawks now seriously folks the new cd from veteran punk band taunt contains some really good punk music my favorite songs are sxe help me begin and emotions inside their latest cd shows the development of a mature taunt if you like punk you should definitely have this one in your collection it is worth the money label lavek aol com i really needed this cd a bad week at work struggles on every side our first baby arriving in weeks needless to say i had a lot on my mind the people at might have wondered what i was listening to while i fought back both tears and shouts of joy the lord used this cd to lift me up it helped me to put things back into perspective label is aleister crowley boring is that possible it s a shame that this book is so tedious because the author knows his subject i read lawrence sutin s biography of pk dick and i was impressed so i had high hopes for this one but there s no structure to the story no plot sutin moves from one moment of crowley s life to the next never making it clear if he s describing a high point a low point a turning point etc halfway through i promised myself i d finish the book sure that as crowley s life reached the end sutin would bring things to a climax but he didn t sutin knows the facts but didn t present them in a compelling way label beginner romance while wolf has written other novels that i have enjoyed this one felt like introduction to historical romance the characters were not in the least complicated nor was the story line the language and style felt as if it were intended for a very young female audience nell would be interesting to a sixteen to twenty-one year old reader but not to one with more mature sensibilities even the vocabulary felt simplified this does not make this a bad book merely one that i could not recommend to anyone with any understanding of the period or who wanted a more fully developed love story it might be a good book to use to introduce your daughter or granddaughter to historical romance novels but i d prefer something there with more life to it and better characters the sex scenes are tepid the characters are one-dimensional and there is a lot of internal prayer and moralising if you like that sort of thing label adventure and thoughts great book who says we have to travel to far away places for adventure tim palmer had what for most of us would be a lifetime of adventures on this month journey at the same time the people he introduces us to and the observations he shares about all that he sees will make any reader think harder about our place on and responsibilities to this world label cute movie doris day and gig young were very good in this movie so was clark gable but i thought he was a bit old for the part a very enjoyable movie label gable does comedy this movie is a delight doris day and clark gable are very funny together he is a hard boiled newspaper man and she is a journalism teacher together they teach each other about newspapers and love gig young is very amusing in a supporting role doris sings too check this one out you won t be disappointed happy movie watching aloha haleiwa jon label flash back in time i enjoyed reading this book it took me back in the day when values virtues and raging hormones were on a balancing scale ha-ha i found it wholesome funny and heartwarming this generation could look back in time and realize the complexities of a teenager are still the same i would like to see this made into a movie on the big screen label a gift for a die hard fan he wears it to work and he gets alot of attention so i guess it was worth buying grear price label not for beginners this product looks terrific with a lot of games interesting features etc but very soon you will be dissappointed as the program returns you to the same place again and again you can do nothing about this the seller s help is also useless after weeks of training i had to quit the program label jhiadb what a creep the author is a homewrecker liar and hypocrite people who bought his book should get a refund and apology label revvmjones the book was great but condition was the worst i have seen many pages upon opening the book just fail out so how i continued to manage reading the pages that fail out first label great relaxation cd both my and year old both love this cd at bedtime so sweet to hear the yo doing the deep breathing and telling her toes to go to sleep works like a charm b c they re usually fast asleep way through and it works on me too sometimes we just play the soft music on repeat label great read i absolutely loved this book i couldn t put it down i haven t been able to say that since the shopaholic series this book had great insight to trials of the modern family i laughed i cried i was inspired i highly recommend this book as i see other reviewers think her other books is better i will be reading it as soon as i get my hands on it label a story of life i enjoyed jennifer weiner s first book good in bed but i loved in her shoes this is the story of three women rose a lawyer who is more focus on her studies then her looks maggie her younger sister who is gorgeous but everything she touches becomes a disaster and ella the estranged grandmother who can link the past to the future i can t wait for the movie label disapointing how can the author of good in bed produce such drivel i am sorely disapointed with the sophmore release nothing grabbed me here the characters are one dimensional the plot nearly non existant and just generally boring i did not feel any sympathy for any of these characters nor did i care what happened to them if you want to read a good weiner book read good in bed again label hard to put down jennifer weiner has yet again writting another book that s hard to put down you can t seem to help but figure out what will happen next to the two main characters rose and maggie if you are reading these reviews and trust what people are saying pick up this book whether you are to buy it or borrow it from a library and you ll end up devouring it i started just this morning and i ve finished not once did i have to force myself to pick up this book because it has been in my hands nonstop label in her shoes well i m actually reading this book right now because it was recommended in this magazine i read i m reading it in hebrew but by browsing in the author s website i can see it s translated in her style and really well might i add i really like the book especially the parts with ella i d defenatly recomend in her shoes label steve earle in tracks included on steve earle s live from austin tx in are as follows transcendental blues everyone s in love with you another town taneytown hard-core troubadour someday telephone road the devil s right hand more than i can do i can wait goodbye steve s last ramble copperhead road the unrepentant and christmas in washington this concert presents a striking contrast from steve earl s performance in at the same venue during his clean cut days steve has grown tremendously over the years as both a singer and a song writer damn steve on mandolin on copperhead road is priceless love copperhead road this is a must have dvd for steve earle fans and if you happen to have his performance you will come close to having complete concert footage spanning most of his career the sound quality and video are satisfactory label helps maintain existing strength i ve been going to the gym for about years pretty consistently now i try to get there at least times a week but during the busy holiday months that doesn t always happen i normally use muscle milk but decided to give this a try after seeing it while i didn t really notice too much increase of energy nor gains while using this i was able to keep my muscle mass and the amount of weight i am pushing at the gym consistent even when only going once or twice a month so i think it works pretty well so maybe if you use this every day and lift almost every day you would see better gains but i really just wanted to maintain and it helped me with that so i would use it again label just the best we shopped around on the internet and decided to go with the t-fal fit n clean for these reasons it has an upper and lower heating element variable temp control and you can put the whole unit in the dishwasher we ve found it to be everything we wanted in an indoor grill clean-up couldn t be easier we love it label immature unlikeable main character i was excited to read this book because the title indicated that it could be a compelling book instead it was so boiler plate that i knew from almost the outset who was responsible and it was a chore to have to read through it just to find out what i already knew also the characters were just dull or in the case of meagan annoying the entire plot of her involvement in questioning a suspect was unbelievable actually the entire book could have been a high school writing project label somewhat disappointed after reading the great reviews i was really looking forward to this book but i was disappointed the author s prose was excellent and the story well conceived but the only compelling character happens to be the victim dr diana duprey whose story is told through flashbacks she is a multi-layered and very interesting character her husband frank is bland and her daughter megan is a spoiled brat i wanted to reach out and choke her halfway through the book the romance if you can call it that between megan and the detective seemed unnecessary and not believable i also saw the ending coming a mile away i kept waiting for a twist at the end but it didn t come label somewhat helpful but disappointing one of the best things about the book was it mentioning to do the ncaa unfortunately you cannot do that in the game having the information available about the schools over half of the book and their favorite plays was helpful so was the descriptions of the plays however the play images did not include player movement which is crucial there is no excuse to save space for such crucial information one of the big reasons for such books is to be able to carry it and not have to have the game in front of you the instructions and strategy are good but not great helpful but disappointing label if you are easily betrayed anyone who might believe that the men who don mickey or minnie outfits and dance around the world of disney are all ex-college heterosexual football jocks might also be shocked and entertained by this wasted journalism corporate america is seldom what it seems and disney is a corporation label if you like rice cakes these are a great choice let s face it there are types of people in this world those who like rice cakes those who don t i like these because they are vegan not too salty crunchy although they do make crumbs quite easily so much easier to buy these in bulk popcorn flavor is light but it does have more flavor than the plain ones label zippo lighter fluid zippo fluid burns much cleaner than most others so its far easier to keep my lighter clean of course there is a bit of odor to the fluid but i personally like it yeah yeah don t say it i ve seen some of these cans leak at the cap when tilted but mine doesn t its simple enough to grab and pour fluid into a zippo even being the large oz can i m not saying anything that others already haven t so i ll end with this if you want your zippo to stay reasonably clean not stink horribly and burn consistently get the zippo brand other brands will work just not as well label it seems to require a small tool to pop open the spout it should let me open without any tools plus there are no instructions for opening the fuel works of course label good fuel this is official brand zippo fuel which i guess is a good thing i ve been told by zippo enthusiasts that you can use different fuels in your zippo but this will always be popular because it has the zippo logo on it the fuel itself smells exactly like lighter fluid that you put on your grill and comes in a metal canister note when i first got this i pried the nozzle up and it flung zippo fluid in my eye be careful when opening the container also it comes out very fast and if you re not careful will leak onto things label zippo refill bought with zippo hand warmers which was nice because it came with a cap to fill came unopened and as described on time label bad sets egyptians garbed like catholics what happens on the stage has none of the fun you look for a bare-breasted woman hauling in a snake some egyptian priests have on lace-fringed surpluses looking like catholic priests altar boys in the background women wearing crosses nestled in their cleavages the director really screwed this one up listen to cds and use your imagination label not so hot great features not so hot food comes out as is if it was steamed trays are with in a few months already loosing there non sick coating label not the quality you expect be sure to listen to a few previews before purchasing this album my guess is that these recordings are very early versions of the original songs label brilliant many other reviewers have probably covered the plot and characters so i won t waste space by reiterating it here i just want to say how wonderfully interesting this book was i wasn t able to put it down i didn t loathe any characters strange for me and had fallen in love with several of them by the end of the story this book will not waste your time like so many others do you will go back and reread it over and over again just as i have label am i missing something after reading all the glowing reviews for this game i cannot believe how incredibly dull and tedious it was i gave up in the middle of the third case the only reason i got that far was that i assumed i was missing something that surely it must get better i did not find this game to be challenging at all it s a matter of reading through page after page of text clicking on everything in a room to get all the evidence and presenting everything you ve got in court i see no comparison between this and games where you actually have to solve puzzles like myst or the nancy drew games label nontraditional but entertaining this is simply put not a game for everyone this isn t a shoot em up or action adventure you play the role of duh phoenix wright a young attorney just starting out you gather evidence follow the leads and question witnesses on the stand trapping them in their own lies if you re the type who loves looking for all the details twisted wordplay and loves a good puzzle this is your game if all you re looking for is mindless violence feel free to pass label poor film making at its finest bloody awful character actions lack motivation logic or explanation acting is brilliantly mediocre dialogue what little there is between flashbacks and dream sequences lacks punch and believability plotif it can be called thatis tedious scenes drag on and on it s pretty much a given that gay cinema sucks this film does nothing to dispel that notion i thought the directors other film shank was dreadful but this wow even worse label hey thanks what a way to start the day my students are having a ball listening to the songs from dr jean label great book a must buy for cfers this book will prepare you for the exam thursday i started reading from page one saturday i was on the last page that s how smooth it is written ben forta emphasized that it is not a cheat-sheet but instead it helps with all the fundamentals of cf i highly recommend this book for those that have some experience on their hands but need the extra assurance to pass the exam today i took and pass the certified coldfusion developer exam i wouldn t say the book was the reason i pass but it sure built a lot of fundamental skills and confident in me to pass if you feel like you might pass the exam this book will make you feel even better about your skills xman label sorry this item is not worth the purchase price unraveling the inner game to slightly used cars sales success onlinei purchased this about months ago but didn t get around to listening until today the cd has nothing to do with the used car business it is a recording of a telephone interview which discusses motivational techniques for all business the title is less than honest but is only slightly justified by the instruction to go to a certain website for more about the used car business but that information is kindergarten level stuff which can be obtained free on most any online search engine if you need motivation buy good motivational books available most anywhere and if you need help in used car sales this will not help you label a wonderful book for the diana collector this is a wonderful picture book for the collector of princess diana memorabilia the tribute from author william holden was touching with various tidbits regarding his relationship with the princess there was a nice mixing of color photos from her private and also her public life the pictures in this book seem to bring out the laughter and charming spirit that was the princess diana label looks better than it works not a bad idea two hemispheres grab enough mix to form a meatball problem if the meatball mixture is really good like from cooks illustrated the mix is stickyand the two halves don t let go even with timely dipping in water or whatever we found a medium ice cream cookie scoop e g oxo good grips medium cookie scoop works better the rotating bail inside the scoop forces the meatball outeven if the mix is sticky label the best playstation game ever made this game is challenging yet not too hard to play so i didnt find myself banging my head against the floor in anguish trying to finish it it was long yet entertaining every minute it is the only game is the years of playing games computer playstation that i will play again as a horror fan i loved fatal frame and silent hill and fancied resident evil but now this game tops every game ive ever played scary exciting interesting controls were cool too in the past i had a hard time with resident evil controls eventually catching on i look forward to resident evil and i heard it is only going to be released on x-box i may be wrong but if it is im buying an x-box label greatest of all time i actually bought this game soon as it came out for ps2 for dollars i kept puting off playing it so one day i finally sat down to play it wow this game blew me away the graphics are the best i have seen and the pro logic sound makes it come alive on any surround sound system a great purchase for me and hopefully any ps2 owner label the prequal to resident evil nemesis i just started this game and it is a lil so to get started and a little difficult to get going and the zombie s are kinda tuff to kill cause they can throw there ax s and they have dinomites i have yet to see the first boss which is a big fish with a big mouth this game is slow to get started but i will see how good it is at the end label quick service i damaged my s60 and needed a replacement this fit the bill perfectly both in cost and quick service no problems with the camera label there are better books i thought this would be cute for my toddler because he loves books and we re starting to get into potty training the quality of the board book isn t great and the content is even worse there are definitely better books out there for children but i thought i d give it a try because the price was right i won t bother returning it but i wouldn t recommend it label really cute the little ernie is so cute and my daughter loves telling him not to use too much toliet paper good strong board book as well which is what every kid in this age group needs label too short and not visual enough it s not worth your money poorly written looks that sales of it rely on the known character erni good marketing label potty book for year old son i bought this book for my son to read while potty training he enjoys it but it is extremely vague in the actual process of what goes into the potty training process for example it skips from ernie got a new potty to when ernie has to go he sits on the potty and goes i pretty much don t even read the words but rather am descriptive for my son i will read it when ernie has to pee-pee or poopie i would not recommend this as a real learning experience for your child but as i said my son does enjoy looking at it label unimpressed i didn t find this very encouraging the wording was unimpressive and the only draw was the baby ernie label flimsy not informative first off the board book pages are thiner than most board books i have little boys and they re really hard on stuff we had this book for weeks before the pages got bent in half second i didnt like the fact that ernie used way to much toilet paper the day after we read this book i found my bathroom covered in toilet paper yeah the probably would have done that anyway but the book didnt help the situiation not a huge fan of the new sesame street label great hard core punk band the gotohells are a great punk band i first heard them on the cd five years on the streets since then i have been a huge fan they have so much energy and i would recomend this cd for anyone punk fan label another hit by maxted i fell in love with anna maxted novels after reading getting over it running in heels and behaving like adults a tale of two sisters is a novel about two jewish sisters lizbet and cassie growing up in london and dealing problems related to trying to get pregnant the main plot of this book is about about pregnancy adoption the people you will always love and those you fall out of love with i started this book on a saturday morning and didn t put it down until that night a definite read label a lot of noise but not much music slow going this movie hardly managed to keep my attention it plays a lot like a made-for-tv film and yet the movie contains a great monologue by its main character about what heaven and hell are and how it s the summation in our brain s reactions to our entire lives that determines the way we spend our eternity label special now now now in this age of hi-tech and instant gratification it is not proper to restore retouch everything to pristine quality imagine tampering with the mona lisa because it looks too drab sure this dvd has flaws the horrid anglo dubbing should go keep the original french and give us subtitles however this is pure nostalgia the flavor and essence of piaf and her amours the breathtaking marcel cut in his prime then theo marlene dietrich josephine baker jean marais cocteau romy schneider alain delon jean paul belmondo etc we get glimpses of the not so distant past this is a perfect mood piece instead of an in your face documentary a must have for the serious collector label for devoted fans only this dvd should be viewed by devoted fans only and preferably french speaking fans at that the picture quality is extremely poor the appearances of piaf are cobbled together and the sound is atrocius it s dedinitely not one for the average viewer label big dissappointment essentially the problem for me was that the dubbing was done so obtrusively and so poorly that it becomes painfully embarrassing to watch this dvd in english which is the only option subtitles would have done the trick nicely enabling us to hear the people onscreen yet understand them when piaf talks her voice is immediately paved over by the voice of non-actor reading a translation of piaf s words beyond that it seemed a bit ragtag as a documentary some interesting details but it all feels rather like an inexpensively made tv special that makes do with whatever odds and ends are most readily available label cybershoot dscs90 i ve been a sony fan as long as i remember but this product is the worst sony ever made picture qulity is bad it won t take a high capacity memory stick it s big and heavy i m looking for a diffrent camara now and this one is going to be my little girl toy label stay far far far away from sony ok so we got this camera about years ago and paid ish we take pictures once maybe twice a year and no more than a total so far well i needed it for a school project tomorrow and guess what it s dead it will let me look at the pictures i took three months ago but nothing else it instantly shuts right back off better yet after an hour of internet research apparently several people have had this problem so i dug out my old sony camera it took two good pictures and then the picture video card fried it literally started trembling in my hand i m done with sony last month our two year old sony dvd player died too this used to be the best quality company around now they ve obviously turned to crap label great condtioner this combined with the moisture maniac is a great solution to my thin hair the dry winter weather and heat and sun in the summer just ruin my hair so i need a daily shampoo and conditioner that actually keeps my hair healthy i am really happy with this stuff however bed head exaggerates it s products humorous marketing tactic so this is not the ultimate cure for dry hair i still use a clarifying shampoo and deep hydrating mask twice week but this is an excellent in between solution label good mystry with value good read along with personal values and dedication i so enjoyed the mystery and about reaading something that is not the usual time place and characters label good beginning to a great series joe pickett isn t your average hero he s a game warden trainee who becomes involved in a murder when a local outfitter s body appears in his woodpile the plot concerning greedy business interests versus a thought-to-be-extinct mammal in wyoming s beautiful wilderness is familiar but the characterizations are great joe is a courageous yet flawed hero his wife marybeth is loving yet headstrong what happens to the characters in this novel is reflected in their emotional growth over the next books in the series and often has devastating consequences a great read label good first book even though you could tell this was a first of a series with a little disjointed story to start it quickly picked up and was a very fun read it kept my interest through out and the end threw some great twist i recomend this and have already bought the next two in the series label pretty good first book started off a little slow for me but once it picked up i couldn t put it down i am purchasing book number two tonight label skip this one even if you like the vsi series this book is neither very short nor a proper introduction in this case the title is totally misleading with respect to length the book drones on and on and took me a surprisingly long time to finish considering the modest number of pages with respect to being an introduction the author seems more interested in showing his expertise rather than guiding those new to the subject he spends a lot of time on esoterica while failing to clearly present the basics of linguistics for a truly good introduction i suggest teach yourself linguistics by aitchison which is well organized concise and covers all of the basics also check out the excellent audio video linguistics courses offered by the teaching company label still going strong i liked this season as much as the two earlier ones it is fun to watch the new twists on the merlin legend the only weak episode for me that is is the goblin episode but again it is unrealistic to expect all episodes to be perfect label terrible quality control i ordered season the discs came scratched up one wouldn t read properly i got another one sent same thing discs scratched up worse than the first on some of them one disc won t read properly the worst scratched disc in both sets is disc although was scratched in both sets as was either the manufacturer is messing up or the case they re in is messing up the discs the same thing happened with merlin season i had to order twice because the first set was scratched the second one was ok so out of ordered only set was non-scratched i like the show but these dvd sets are junk i d only buy the next ones locally so i could keep returning it until i get a good set label disappointed although shipping on this item was very fast my little one was very disappointed when the product didn t work sadly we are sending it back label material quality not provided i purchased two of of the bollard single hook bath room accessories and expected a full quality product the basic unit meet my expectations with non rusting materials and a chrome finish however the set screws provided were simple carbon steel if used these set screws would soon rust and the product and the tile floor would be stained i had to purchase stainless steel set screws to assemble and install the units label buyer beware i bought the individual volumes combined they have the exact same run time as the complete series set according to amazon however the episode imprint is not included in either volume i wrote to starz anchor bay and they claim it is on the big set what a ripoff it s bad enough they said they d never release the full season in order to sucker people into buying the original individual releases now they pull this nonsense label slow if you are upgrading and your file size is large i would buy something else it takes forever to print i talked to tech support and they know there is a problem and are trying to fix it this is not acceptable the version has a different database than the prior versions and it has made the file much larger and for some much slower i had to buy a new version because i use their payroll services and my is being fazed out april i have just now bought the an ebay after printing the audit trail i was able to record all my transactions while in the version onto my restored version and then upgraded to i know this seems like alot of work but the was that bad for me label buy a hot dog for a and pay every year for the bun quickbooks may be an excellent small business software package but i will never know the ads and discription imply it has a payroll program included in it surprise not only can you not run payroll the cost of the single payroll module is more than the a r a p g l inventory reports and tracking package you just paid for but wait you have the privledge of paying every year i was going to switch from peachtree but at least in pt you can it is very obtuse and cumbersome make the tax changes manually ps copy of quickbooks will be on ebay soon label sign me up for the class action sunset clause lawsuit when it comes imagine you buy a new gm car but after years onstar sends a signal to your onboard computer to self destruct oh sure you can still sit in your car and smell it and look at it and listen to the radio but you sure can t drive it thats the sunset policy intuit enforces after years you cant use your software for any real productivity no one does this even with windows you can still use windows or and still have the full functionality you paid for but to take away functions paid in full not on lease or rent mind you that is total theft i am ashamed i choose to talk myself into upgrading for other reasons namely required many more keystrokes on the register than the simple quicken i used before so finally got me back to the ease of quicken usage despite the fact that would not register until after talking to hashish in india for an hour label love the changes i did not belive it could get more user friendlyif you have a small business it is the only accounting for you label in the year i should not to hack registry hives in the year it is insane that we as it pros still have to hack registry hives to get this software to run as a limited privilege account to better secure our computers quickbooks community running quickbooks as a restricted user admin rights fix when will quickbooks begin to code in a secure manner peachtree does microsoft small business accounting does why does intuit require updates every few years and acts like we are still all running windows machines security is important these days how about stepping up to the plate intuit and getting with the other vendors label cleaner two too flimsily short for its own good some of these sonic subtleties do contain interlocking textures of interest label tears of joy i can not remember how i found this book online but i am glad i did i highly recommend this book for anyone who may have a million and one questions about their own faith it gives you a new perspective and wanting to pray to god at night because you know he hears you there are so many good stories that i want to highlight but i would not give them the justice it deserves so all i want to say today is to please purchase this book i am so glad god creates different types of people with different types of stories because it brings us all closer together label won t lay flat kept bowing out from the garage door no matter how tight i tried to keep it flush finally took it down and installed a more study product label good advice bought this for my sister as a gift upon starting med school she found it enjoyable and said it helped to have a little different perspective along the way label just like in costa rica i loved drinking coffee in costa rica and it is fun to be able to have it in the house label ty beanie babies blue lizzard my son was very happy with this product it was just as it appeared good quality etc label ms neggers does it again i am a fairly recent reader of carla neggers work when i first picked up one of her books i quickly found as many of her past works as possible in my favorite used book store once read i had to wait anxiously for her next book i wasn t disappointed in her latest dark sky it was an exciting nail biting adventure although i was able to figure out who the bad guy was fairly early on it was still a great book to get lost in i would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good romantic suspense label jlo getting to old-o i am so sorry but she has no talent its her butt who gets the glameur she is too old a girl on tv even called her a hoe but that s not my idea she is just to old and not talented label pretty disappointing i ve been a long time fan of ziq i don t know about anyone else but take a quick hit from lunatic harness brace yourself and then put this on there is no comparison much of this cd just seems like the regular its crazy electronic music madness style filler no substance little originality at this point label not the original or the real the mopeds or mopes well once again proving that fine musicianship does not a great rock band make these scandinavian mopeds have layed down more slick and clever tracks to the dismay of us crazy real raw rock and roll lovers just compare these poppy new wave-ish tracks to the bruteish intelligence of the real mopeds also known as the mopes an electric duo from the east coast usa broke up in blasted crazy punk rotten psychedelic grooves and ironic bombast you can checkout a new site dedicated to their memory for free mp3 s www themopes com and compare for yourself the old dive bar heroes or these newer well meaning popsters label oww my ears i believe this is the worst cd i ve ever heard paul wrote some great songs and i even like a half-dozen or so of his singles from the s to the s but what record company exec in his right mind could green-light this awful album the crowd will find it absolutely laughable and paul s core audience s and up will just scratch their heads and say what the there are two laugh-out-loud songs on this cd trust me i played it for several people and the reaction was unanimous mr brightside and against the wind did bob seger actually okay this what is he smoking these days again can t figure out a who would buy this and b who could possibly find it good a friend gave it to me as a gag and i just about did paul thanks for your good work back in the day but please stop the madness your reputation is at stake label out takes from rock swings this was a very disappointing follow up to rock swings rock swings was an amazing record with an unexpected selection of tunes and nearly every one of them meticulously treated to a terrific swing interpretation i was hoping for another helping but alas my strong suspicion is that this album is the tracks that didn t make it on rock swings the only one that could have made it that first album is the first track time after time and after that it all goes tragically down hill label come on paul you are a legend you can do better i am a huge fan of paul anka and he surely has created some of the best songs of the last century however this album is soo boring it could put me to sleep were it not so pretentious anka s got the voice and the songs could have been well covered but the jazzy style he gives to songs such as against the wind or ordinary world is just intolerable sorry mr anka better luck next time label piece of junk the product arrived damaged not from shipping damage but from packing at the factory too damaged to use dealer said they didn t want it back it s a good thing because it was replaced by a unit that wouldn t run i took the fan unit which wan t damaged out of the damaged unit and put it in the second unit and it runs but only at a low fan speed anything higher causes too much vibration noise also both units we received were poorly finished with the base being several shades lighter than the cover which matches the picture on the box it looks like they only gave the bottom one coat of stain thanks to the dealer who refunded our money my email with complaints directly to the manufacturer got no response label had some problems we had this humidifier for days before it quit working before that it worked great the humidity in our home was more comfortable however amazon made it no problem and sent us a new one in about days we ll see how this one last amazon was great in dealing with them label essick humidifier poor quality as several other reviewers discovered this product essick air humidifier is lacking in quality the cabinet is flimsy the unit is noisy and the wick is a disaster poor engineering from the word go the variable speed control causes the motor to hum loudly when used at lower speeds this hum is amplified by the thin light-weight plastic cabinet when the motor is turned up to higher speeds the fan creates an unacceptable level of noise the first time i cleaned the wick following the directions in the owners care use manual the paper element began collapsing and would have completely fallen out had i not caught it in time i seriously regret spending so much money on such an inferior product label funny-looking substitute for the real thing this is a fun-loving item for those that miss having the real bird where they might be residing at the present time e g vacationing for a long time label very noisy at least the unit i received i guess there must be something wrong with the unit i received since pretty much everyone else gave this a good review for me this box had an extremely high noise floor actually it created the same hiss even when i turned drive and gain all the way down so i sent it back i am one of very few people who report this problem about the tubepre which is why i suspect that there might be a small number of defective boxes out there too bad it looked good on paper i liked the vu display and had been looking forward to experimenting with different tubes i ordered the vtb instead i hope that is going to work for me label great product but arduous to clean we bought this product as part of our dr weil weeks to optimum health regimen and we really love it during the winter when the bedroom gets so dry the humidifier really does the trick and it may be in our heads but the air really does seem to be cleaner than in the rest of the house this product has great air quality ratings hepa etc relative to other products in its price range and was easy to set up etc our only gripe is that it is a bit of a pain to clean you need to take it all apart etc however this may be the case with all of these products and thus may just be par for the course we recommend this product whole-heartedly label lightly scented and so gentle my tibetan terrier is sixteen and she has allergies including respiratory ones she is also allergic to oatmeal in shampoos none in this one i have to bathe her frequently to remove pollen and dust the scent is light and doesn t make her sneeze or cough and it doesn t irritate her eyes it would be better if it had no scent but i am very happy with this product label great workout production not so great i am really enjoying this dvd but very disappointed in the music production there are too many empty gaps of no music at all while working out you have to keep walking while waiting for someone to start the music up again i find this really frustrating leslie s wonderful personality makes up for the lack of good production label it s fun and works great i m and love to walk but with the montana winters i am limited this dvd is even better than walking so come spring i ll do both i have already lost inches in the first month although i have yet to lose weight but i feel better and my backaches are less every day in fact i feel the difference when i don t do at least mile in the morning before work label deadman wonderland i love it because it is a really good anime i got it for my friend for christmas she really love it to label great set and cover art but is not uncensored the product is great i enjoy watching this one it is a little paranormal science fiction horror fantasy action drama romance suspense i love my dead man wonderland set but it is not uncensored not completely the introduction is not uncut and there are scenes that are not fully uncut i should know i have seen some of the uncut episodes online overall stars label nice book gets to the point fast like the pda section this book explain the how-tos very clearly i specially like the section on pdas overall i found the book very useful label ginger drink a real discovery i tasted the ginger drink in the form of tea on a recent trip to visit a son and daughter-in-law in ljubljana it seemed very restorative and i was pleased to order some from the website he furnished and get it so quickly if i happened to have an upset stomach or a cold it would be even better very bracing label a true treasure with a colorful look not only is this bear huggable kissable and pretty it is also a true treasure unique in its own way with a different array of colors for each individual bear great for kids who are allergic to loose fur found on most plush toys this bear has a material so soft so smooth and has a great clean feeling it is also a true collectible label nother piece of junk really disappointed by this product to actually get the spray you have to really ramp up pressure so the plants are wiped out by the pressure stupid set up could a part be missing label great camera but storage isn t great camera great pictures but the storage is terrible a floppy disk can hold only so many images and it ll hold only one megapixel image there are better soloutions out there compactflash cards can hold mb of images at the least iomega clik for digital cameras drives can hold mb of imagery and floppy disks are expensive i highly reccomend this for novices but for serious photographers stay away label friendly easy to use and convenient camera if you are looking for a convenient smart and easy to use camara this is it while resolution is not as good as other camaras if you need it for web applications its good enough one very good feature at least for me is its great macro capability and manual focus you can take objects as close as cm you can also control the exposure level which for close distance shots is a very usefull feature but the best feature for me is the fact that it stores in floppy disks this is a convenient storage media and while the storage capacity is not big they are so cheap you can buy as many as you need overall i m very happy with it i strongly recommend it label sony service sucks the camera itself has excellent features the pictures are fair in conparison with other cameras priced hundreds less olympus d zoom and others but the best feature is easy downloads that can be e-mailed directly out label much too light in color lovely bracelet if you like a clear look with a hint of color the picture presented is clearly showing a light color of aquamarie the bracelet received looks clear label fascinating i would have to recommend this movie to people who enjoy atypical yet thought-provoking movies it is different and not for people not willing to think outside the box this is a movie about friendship love loss sadness and the general simplicities in life that are usually over looked this movie was definitely sad and also made me happy i enjoyed the many meaningful messages presented throughout the movie there are many great quotes and provides a different view of how life can be perceived and how life is changing at most i would say this movie provides a wonderful message about friendship a genuine friendship that is rare today you can do many fancy things to prove you are best friends but does your friendship provide you a sense of hope and inspiration you are my best friend you are my only friend one person can make a difference in a persons life as mary and max had did for one another label great deal this is my second projector and first viewsonic it is small compact and delivers a great picture very pleased with my projector much better than getting a wide screen tv label does not perform as stated and implied and will smoke you out rather than leave you smokeless this item was an exciting idea but it stopped there after receiving of these items both were tried and very little if any smoke made it to the filter even when holding a cigarette within an of an inch from the intake usage of this item even as only a simple ashtray is not possible as the holders are so small that any cigarette of normal size does not fit the item is made of what is clearly the cheapest materials and it shows in the workmanship the plastic housing wiring battery cap and filter are reminiscent of that cheap or dollar toy car with lights one finds and discount stores the practical application of this smokeless ashtray will leave you smoked out and frustrated with only a waste of your time and money label seems that they have mango varieties a few months ago a friend turned me on to a bag of the mariani phillipine mango i had been hooked i was excited when i saw that amazon sold it in bulk when the order arrived i opened a bag i was so disappointed the variety amazon carries is the mariani thailand mango and the one i went crazy for was the mariani phillipine mango there was a huge difference in taste texture now i ll have to see who wants the unopened bags i have at least i can buy the ones i like at my local jewel food store label awful blanched tasteless and hard i can t believe they actually sent this to me labeled as food i am presently researching a means of returning this product label goes haywire regularly setup was easy enough but this printer routinely goes haywire spitting out a whole cartridge load of paper and refusing to print i have tried it with several different pcs with this same intermittent weird behavior only a reset of both the printerand the computer seem to fix everything i m off to buy an epson label old fashioned sweet story not much of a challenge to read enjoyed it just the same it was a change from the modern world and therefore i recommend it label stay away this just plain bad boring i did not find this the least bit entertaining nor interesting it was a waste of my time label worst movie ever go break open a red light camera and steal the film watch that it will have times better acting and a much more coherent plot too label blu-ray review what a terrible movie garbage it totally sucks what is hollywood coming to it seems they are running out of stories to make movies about what garbage good lord right up there with boondock saints and smokin aces label last nicolas cage film for me there is not one redeemable quality about this film period nicolas cage is at the bottom of the barrel he now has absolutely no range the acting in this was worse than a low budget b movie i think he seriously was on something so here we are new orleans post katrina nic is supposed to be a tough guy and gets into all kinds of trouble i couldn t figure out who was coming or going i was baffled the entire movie the lines were horrible please save your money label what did i watch so he s a dirty cop and an all around horrible person spoiler everything worked out in the end what the heck was the point of that movie seriously everything worked out in the end i don t know why i continued to watch label great writing i think the above review needs a corrective tynan was the sharpest funniest and best-informed theatre critic of his generation he was also a wonderful stylist and a precocious one many writers never write as well as tynan did while still in his teens these letters can be enjoyed simply for their manipulation of language but there s more to them than that tynan always liked to think of himself as an outsider as someone pushing the envelope yet he also was entranced by the establishment at play and he enjoyed lowbrow entertainment almost as much as shakespeare and sophocles these letters demonstrate this bifurcation of character making for a sort of un-selfconscious autobiography well worth buying for anyone who likes reading letters and a must for tynan fans when can we have some more of his work reisssued label if you can t make it to mongolia this season mykel board punk rocker new yorker gonzo provocateur fulfills a lifetime dream by moving to mongolia for one year to teach english and i m so glad he did his easy-to-read writing style is brutally honest and hysterically funny from his problems overcoming constipation because metamucil is not sold in outer mongolia board resorts to consuming rancid street food to encourage diarrhea to his visits to mongolian dance clubs to the confusing hurdles presented in this post-soviet limbo land welcome to mongolia is the standard response from natives when cultural idiosyncracies are brought to attention unlike most travel memoirs there are no overwrought or pretentious analyses of a foreign culture even though there were times that i a fellow traveler longed for mykel to take a deeper look at this rarely examined country making this book a fun unrestrained ride through a remote kafka-esque kingdom buy this book label banal and boring no i m not making this up somebody actually produced this recording actually two people produced it nearly two string quartets were assembled to play on it i say nearly because most of the tracks were played by a trio who apparently used overdubbing to inflate themselves into a quartet i m not sure that any string quartet could have made this music seem appropriate or entertaining these folks certainly were not up to the task the end result is so banal and boring that it does not even work as a novelty record that might be fun to play at parties unbelievable label great item i find this item to be more than expectedand i think everyone should consider buying onei will tell everyone about it label amazing score wow words can barely express the awesomeness of this piece first i will start with the movie brilliant that is all there is to be said about the film now the ost beautiful work a very dark and somber piece very moody and atmospheric its not something you just listen to for fun at least for me its more of a background music while doing your business its just brilliant every track in amazing from beginning to end i was unfamiliar with johnny klimek and reinhold heild s work this cd however makes me want to definatly look into it it is the perfect sound to go along with the dark nature of the film some tracks are very tranquil and moody while others pound out beats and are very fast paced all in all a for the cd a definate must have for any collection highly recommneded label do not buy this camera its a very nice camera don t get me wrong however due to its compact design the speaker is too close to the tape motor during quiet and not so quiet areas you will hear a high pitched humm coming from your camera as well as on what you record canon confirmed this as a design flaw the zr45 and all do this i was really disappointed i returned mine i wish there was a way to fix it label brio medium straight track brio is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market these pieces are a must for extending your existing train set my year old loves having these extra pieces to create with label it s too simple even for a kiss book i know the whole point of dummie and kiss books is that they are supposed to be easy for anyone to understand but this book was too simpletoo basic i read a chapter and could hardly bear to invest anymore time in it since the information was so sparse if i hadn t gotten this book for a steal i would have been very upset at my waste of money there was just no real information what a waste label quality from tripp lite as always i always goes with the trip lite fiber patch cables due to their quality and not being so proud of their name they triple the price label awful big waste of money after washing noticed pillow case was a different shade and so wrinkled no matter what i ve tried stuck with it since i washed and can t find packaging label good grill for the money i ve been very happy with this easy to use and clean grill i ve used it to grill steaks duck breasts veggies and chicken takes longer than a gas grill but gets to job done without smoking up the kitchen label excessive typos ruined it for me couldn t agree more w prendergast s review concerning the laughable typos i thought the proof reader or editor of the version i had must be abusing drugs themselves how distracting to read a so called classic and find it reading like a hs sophomore paper and a drunk sophomore at that i somehow managed to finish the book but came on amazon immediately following it to see if others read the same erroneous version weird typos poor punctuation etc ruined it for me label entertaining action movie spoilers the main reason why i waited up until in the morning cause i am a fan of chris lambert i saw it id say it was excellent of the action and the acting done by chris lambert and ice t great action and i was dissapionted when christopher lambert was told by marcus that he killed his daughter when he didnt and so they killed each other and that ugly old woman who can t even act probably old enough to look like shes mabye she is so it was very entaining worth a watch label one more positive note don t know if anyone else has addresed this i have been building my barn shop for years now the book covers many of my thoughts and concerns would have wanted this sooner than later points raised for consideration noise and sound i put in some wood walls painted white and sealed against moisture but i fussed with that or drywall i considered my own sound issues and went with wood but after reading some of the author s comments i will be spending extra time for fire protection and sound absorption when i do other parts of the shop not for me alone but for my nieghbors as well good book to read before during or contemplating a shop hey we get to find out about how the masters of wood roughed it as well label criminally stupid mistake to not provide the orginal sound don t buy this video with dvd technology it would have been a no-brainer to provide both sound tracks the original aussie version and the rotten american dubbed version these dopes chose to give us the one that nobody wants perhaps if nobody buys it they ll get a clue label this is the movie that introduced me to the awesomeness of action movies of the s this is probably mel gibson s first film a film he s done while he was in his s there is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native australia but this film launched him as an international movie star especially since they released mad max which was universally released as the road warrior and the road warrior is one of my top ten favorite films of the s sure mad max has some of that cheesy seventies style but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today mad max is that one film being over years old that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than years old today this film is a classic in the action hero dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre label great dvd packed with a ton of features i ve seen mad max dozens of times but after watching the new se dvd it was like watching it again for the very first time that is not an exaggeration the new dvd offers the choice of the poorly dubbed us soundtrack or the original australian soundtrack watch the original track the pacing of the film changes entirely as do the characters the original soundtrack breathes new life into this film the features are great there s a trivia track that pops up info about the production cars and aussie slang terms used as you watch it documentaries tv spots theater trailer and more the print is fabulous and it turns out this is a film you really need to see in widescreen having seen it both ways now i can tell you that the pan scanned version misses a lot of the stuntwork and chase scene action if you ve seen this movie in the past and thought it was ok this new dvd will have you saying it was great label awful this was the absolute worst book that i have ever read it the dullest most boring thing since i learned algebra after the first chapter i already wanted to kill myself but i gave it another chance and another and another and another i was continually dissapointecd do not waste your hard earned money on this aboration of a book label oh my god it s stereolab ever since i got this album since last summer i kept on thinking what this album will sound like i never wanted to stop listening to this album because their music is so spectacular if you heard the first track laetitia kinda does the loud humming and someone keeps on playing the synthesizer it reminds me of the beatles eerie song revolution from the white album i could ve just imagined while listening to baby lulu and it makes your mind clear with soothing and beautiful sounds this is the best album i ve ever heard and i listen to this album while i study and you should listen to this while you re at work or home stereolab totally gets your stresses away by listening to them bye-bye label perfect family fun this is a very funny movie that stars martin short as murray a bumbling fairy god-mother who can hardly do anything right his first job is helping anabel greening played by mara wilson anabel s wish is that her dad is auditioning for a part in a broadway musical and she wants him to get the part unfortunately murray accidentally turns her dad into a statue when anabel her brother charlie and murray go to nafgaa and tell the queen of the fairy godmothers what happened she tells anabel that if they don t reverse the spell by midnight he will remain a statue forever before they can do that they have to get the wands back from the evil claudia i highly recommend a simple wish label great kids movie the kids loved this movie martin short is hillarious the fact that it still teaches kids you dont always get what you ask for label funny this movie has the little girl from matilda and martin short good family picture we loved it came in excellent condition label excellent album i have known kenneth copland since he has always set very high standards for the recording prpduction of all his albums this album is no exception label well played kid s music trout fishing in america make kids music they do it well and the album probably will stand up to the death play the kids will give it even with adults although i highly doubt many adults will listen to it for it s own merits if you need a cd for your kids to listen to that won t drive you crazy you have found it but otherwise this is probably not a cd you want to own label highway robbery it always amazes me how some outside vendors try to gouge consumers with their highly over-priced items on here you can bet i ll never buy anything from this vendor even if it is a great deal this is a ridiculously high price for red bull on sale in the stores one can find it for can why would someone pay more than that online caveat emptor let the buyer beware label well i also really loved the book it showed two strong willed people who are at first glance totally wrong for each other i mean a centuries old vampire and a vampire slayer it was ironic i also liked that even though quin was a cold fish on the outside inside he was just as lonely as rashel even if he rarely admitted it i loved the book and couldn t put it down if u haven t read it yet do so label where are the woodwinds the performances seem fine the recording is a mess the woodwinds are lost in the intro to festive overture because there is too much reverberation the mics must have been placed in the back of an empty hall more like a cavern this is a real disappointment because the orchestra is outstanding this is a one listen cd then file it away forever label vivid colors tight fit only lasts a few times this puzzle has lovely graphics and a sturdy construction as others have mentioned the pieces are tight and difficult to maneuver right out of the box because they are all wood and cut from one piece after about three uses however they are now smooth and fit together well i have not had a problem with splinters but if you are too rough when you first break apart the pieces i could see how splinters might develop my month old daughter loves this puzzle and had no trouble putting it together without a visual guide the colors of each area are very distinguishable so it s pretty easy to determine where each piece connects we are happy customers label these shoes are made for walking in the merrill way these are great shoes as my daughter says merrills are a hug for the feet even though there are minimal straps they are in the right places and adjustable these go everywhere i love them label persuasive book with an unusual approach the book details many or most of the important dynamics of the war as it took place within a single provice in the process bergerud reveals much about what is important to know about the war as a whole for me personally this is possibly the most important vietnam book i ve read this is because it provided me a framework for understanding the war from the beginning of american involvement to the end that i still use for many readers this could be an important first book to read about vietnam and america s relations to it label another sensual gem from this composer this is yet another lush shimmering pscyo-erotic opera by franz schreker wonderfully performed by the forces involved i suggest you just read the review of to get a good summary of the surreal plot at least one other reviewer has termed it not as a good as the composer s masterpiece die gezeichneten and while i wouldn t disagree with that judgement this music drama comes pretty close to matching its sibling particularly in the second half other than mozart bizet s carmen and a small handful of others i m not a great opera fan but schreker s output in this genre to be absolutely stunning highly recommended label kingston technology kvr133x64c3 pc133 mb mx64 works great just snap it into the slot and turn on my pc in a few seconds i was up and running and my pc working much faster that before label you ll enjoy this cd i got a huge kick out of vinny s interpretations of the beatles songs that they never recorded sure they ver due elements from the later years that they should have skipped as has been written here but the don t mimic previous covers but try to recreate the early beatle sound it s light and it s fun it s is not a must have as a beatles fan but i think you ll get a big kick out of this disc label madonna is a great singer madonna is a great singer who sings an even better musical she is so full of emotion that on her last wispers of lament it actually sounds like she is about to enter immortality while in the song beuonos aires she sounds like a ambitious young girl yelling for attention she is a great actor if i could change one thing it would be to switch jimmy nail and jonathin pryce because nail should sing more songs and price should sing less label evita evita evita evita evita evita all i can say is wow i never thought madonna could sing like this now i am a huge fan of hers antonio banderas s accent makes him fit the part of che very nicely the songs are incomparable if i could change one thing it would be jonathan pryce because he has an annoying voice label disappointed in product quality and support after returning the first version of this product because of constant paper jams the replacement would not recognize the printer drivers from the first or allow me to replace them in trying to overcome this through hp s support line the recorded message said i would be directed to a representative and then promptly cut off the call twice returned that version also label a text book worth keeping for reference this is a text book that i will not be selling back i like the reference style set-up with tabbed pages i am sure i will be referring to it throughout the rest of my college courses label a small leak right out of the box i had to try sleeping on it the first night in a couple of hours it was less firm which made it difficult to roll around on it didn t take long to realize that buying this bed was a mistake returning it will be very difficult because it is almost impossible to fit it back in its original carton because one cannot evacuate all of the residual air necessary to make it fold up small enough prospective buyers should be mindful of this label did not last long we used this for less than days for a guest it does everything as advertised except that it began to leak air by the time you wake up in the morning it has shrunk to less than half it s inflated height there is a patch kit included but we could not find where the air was coming out we had to return it to amazon we bought a single folding bed instead with a memory foam mattress not compact but less risky than an airbed label it s a great value i purchased a twin size intex pillow airbed and was so impressed with the quality that i ordered a second it was easy to inflate held it s firmness was very easy to take down and easily stored now when my granddaughters come to visit they have their own bed and great pajama parties label great bed for guests i highly recommend this item and it s a great price with amazon prime my son uses this whenever he sleeps over he loves it says that it s like sleeping on a cloud with the electric pump which is attached it inflates and deflates super fast it also folds up into a rather small rectangle and it comes with a canvas bag for store label comfortable sleep i found this air bed to be perfect for person the ease in filling the height all exceptional i would reccomend this bed to anyone label intex pillow rest twin airbed with built-in electric pump this product is very difficult for me to use the air pump does not connect easily and i would not recommend it label great bed for guests bought this for my grandson to sleep on when the family came to visit over christmas it is wonderful super easy to inflate and deflate nicely raised off the floor and he said it was very comfortable grandma scored a home run on this one label intex pillow rest twin airbed with built in electric pump excellent value for the money convenient and comfortable i just wish it was a little higher i would recommend this product label do not buy inflates like a charm then deflates under the weight of a child within hours i should have gone with my gut and purchased another aerobed because the one i already have queen has worked for years label it would be great if it stayed inflated i have purchased two of these air mattresses when inflated they are great but during the night they slowing deflate i have yet to discover how to keep these mattresses inflated for eight full hours i wish i would have bought a different air mattress label valve broke after a couple of uses my mother bought this bed for my year old to use when we visited on weekends worked great the first or so times she used it but now the valve that lets the air out won t close it spins but does not seal shut so you can t inflate the mattress very poor quality label ecelente producto funciono sin ningun inconveniente de acuerdo a lo informado en las caracteristicas recomiedo el mismo a todo el que necesite un colchon inflabe comodo y de rapido armado muy bueno el sistema de bomba de aire incorporado al mismo elemento no esnecesario nada mas para utilizarlo label would never buy again this is the third mattress in or weeks and had the same problem with all three they all leaked right from the beginning some worse then the others the built in pump worked great and i liked it very much thus the stars instead of one star i am very thankful for amazon s great return policy it was really a pleasure to deal with them label intex pillow rest twin mattress is a flop we bought these beds in september for our grandchildren to sleep on when they visit they are and and weigh under pounds these beds can not make it through one single night inflated we either have to get up during the night and re-inflate them or the kids will wake us up because the mattresses have lost so much air they are uncomfortable we ve had to repair both beds because they develop pin holes from being folded when we put them away and you can hear air escaping around the area where the beds inflate themselves i m very disappointed in this product and will not buy another air mattress from this company since it s clear their quality has gone down hill drastically since we bought their double bed seven years ago my opinion is save your money and find another solution for guests to sleep on that s what we re doing now label comfortable i bought this air mattress after researching the site it is indeed very comfortable and easy to operate and most important of all no leaking label disappointed but shouldn t be surprised i saw several people had written about air leaks but at that point the majority appeared to be happy with their purchase we ordered two twins for our camp mine started leaking immediately my husbands seemed to be good from spring to nearly winter when his too began to leak so bad that both of us were pumping air several times during the night to keep a little bit afloat that was bad enough but having several friends and family in our bunk house part of the camp awake while doing this pushed it over the edge my father in law bought the same time my husbands started going down hill so it should be interesting to see if it happens again our camp closes down during winter so spring will be the big test i suspect we will go with something a little more expensive and not regret wasting the money we did on these then again my hubby is very good at fixing things so maybe there s hope label works well the air mattress does blow up in seconds it is comfortable it is a little difficult to wrap up and the plug is a little difficult to put back but all and all it was well worth the money my daughter is using it until she can get her new baby to sleep through the night label great for the summer my daughter is living with a couple for the summer this was an alternative to transporting a regular twin bed miles to their house she has been very pleased with the quality and ease of use that is a big deal with her as she has two steel rods in her back as a college student and missions student i m sure it will be used again label quick and easy this bed is so easy to use just plug it in turn it on and walk away the pump is built in so you don t have to worry about keeping up with an air pump using a hairdryer or finding double d batteries to power your pump label love it we recently moved into a smaller place when my parents came into town they took my oldest sons room we needed something for him to sleep on but didn t have much room this twin airbed by intex is great i love the fact that the pump is built in it doesn t get in the way like i thought it might my son says it s very comfortable it s easy to inflate and deflate label great find at a great price i needed to replace my airbed but didn t want to spend a fortune this one works great and it was very economical in comparison to the ones i found in my local bed and bath store label its better then a normal bed i just moved out of my moms house and i did nt want to bring my huge bed dressar with me so i got the airbed its been months since i moved out and i m still sleeping on it you can have it fully inflated for a very firm bed or deflate it for a softer bed i like mine halfway deflated its like sleeping on a cloud label electric pump failed took it to france and electric pump only worked for a minute and blew bought a hand pump to pump it up it was a painful job after it was fully pumped the bed was rather comfortable decided not to bring home to return because once it was pumped there was no way to deflate to the extend that it would fit back into the original box label excellent product for the price durable and extremely comfortable loses a little air over extended use but adding air very easy label great mattress i am in iraq and this mattress is great it is x more comfortable then the things they call mattresses over here label would not recommend i bought this for my off campus residence and the two months it worked fine and then the problems began first two the curves on the top not sure what exactly they are called merged into one so i had to sleep on one half of the bed recently i noticed it was starting to sink and re-inflated it shortly afterward i heard some air and found where it was leaking and didn t think too much off it then in the middle of sleeping i woke up on the floor and then just gave up on it and now am having to resort to sleeping on the floor tried calling their customer support line and it was backed up then i found out that the main support line is for their pools i would recommend a different brand like coleman or getting something from cabela s label is loosing air with almost no use i bought this airbed on october i only used it times and now is loosing air how can it loose air like that with only uses at the beginning it seams good because is comfortable and tall but now i can t use it anymore unless i want fill it with air at the middle of the night label the best air mattress ever i love this air mattress so much it is so easy to inflate and deflate and it is quick too it is very sturdy and durable as well over all it is an excellent gift to anyone who expects to travel and stay over at someone s place or even if you have a lot of guests yourself label fantastic bought the intex pillow rest for visits visitors inflation is quick quiet and easy deflation works the same slight loss of air by early morning fits back into tote nicely take an extra moment when flattened to tuck the sides between the upper and lower fabric fold in thirds length wise then role from bottom toward pump pillow end easy to tote and store label better than the queen size bed i bought this to replace my queen size intex bed that exploded inside only lasted months i like the twin size way better because it feels more reliable with full air than the queen size i think the queen size was just too big that too much weigh in one area caused the explosion inside the twin size is just perfect and it makes my room look even bigger if you re looking for a bed for just yourself this should be perfect label step s best work so far i have been a fan of step rideau and the zydeco outlaws since i purchased their cd standing room only i m so glad has quickly become my favorite some tunes are folksy with a zydeco flare and others are very zydeco this is a must buy for zydeco lovers if the grammys had a catagory for zydeco step would win for performer of the year label bucks i paid at comp usa known for being overpriced over a year ago anyways the case doesn t get the best air so i d recommend getting more fans if you have problems with the front usb hubs pc freezes when you plug something in them unplug the very bottom black wire r r w w g g b b b label dvd review very good comprehensive review on the band gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written a good addition to my collection label not worth the money not what i thought i was getting i don t think jell is as enjoyable as the silicone and unfortunately i had to pay to find out label good it was good is not like out of this world and really amazing but it works soooooo good if you put a lot of pressure when your using it it turns off automatically that sucks label too expensive i used it once and have not touched it since the dolfin wont stay on my clit and the clear stuuf is too soft waste of money label no way this product worked for times the the rotation stopped working batteries run out or lose power after uses i would read reviews before buying another one i am looking into the hitachi wand massager now and i believe i will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power not impressed with this product label not worth the money what a let down i was so excited to get this because of the reviews but when i tried it it did nothing first it is very heavy and hard to hold if you are using it by yourself second it hurts your clitoris it is very sharp on the ears that s the part that goes on you clit i m almost temped to cut them off third and forth it smells and it is very loud i ve tried it about times trying to get used to it my husband has tried to use it on me too no luck at all this is not worth the money label great prodct for those wondering like myself this does come in a discrete package now as for the actual product omg i ve never felt something like this before this is my first official toy and i am sooooo pleased it s a little large and kinda hard but that s okay works wonderfully i would definitely recommend especially for the price label awful this was much bigger then i had anticipated that being my own fault but the reason i gave it only star is because the plastic was so hard it hurt the bunny for my clit irritated it and was not one bit pleasurable so my man suggested i turn it around and then my taint became irritated not one bit pleased with this product label too big while i love the jack rabbit feature the vibrator is overall too big for me to use i can sort slip it inside but its tight and not very comfortable maybe because its too big i cannot feel the beads at all i don t think they have any room to move the vibrator is also quite heavy it would be perfect if it were more slender so girls who are not very big down there might not want to buy this product label awful i was misguided by the review ratings in all honesty this product is awful it has a toxic smell to it and the bunny ears cause more pain than pleasure i don t recommend this product label hate it i am very hard to please because i like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration this item does not work for what i intended it for i tried it twice and hated it both times i was so worked up from trying to make it work that i had to switch back to my bullet i gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol she loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me label fantastic and fast this is definitely better than my last jackrabbit and much higher quality i got the clear one cause like other reviews say your eye really doesn t jump to it if it is left out and it just looks more mature and less bubble-gum my first vibrator hahaha it s really quiet for something that moves does so much and it is more powerful than i expected i had to keep it on the medium settings for both the rotation and vibration but even that got the job down in seconds yeah i timed it this might take some getting used to for some but i absolutely love it the only downside of this is that the rabbit ears part needs to be a little more lifted off the shaft so you can position it in more ways over you than just the one people have been complaining of a weird plastic smell and it kind of does have a smell but only if you physically put your nose right on the thing and inhale and it went away after or washes i highly recommend buying this label after years this album is still awesome this album contains danceable techno and mellow techno trancey ambient unlike most albums all of the songs on this album are great you ll definitely get your money s worth from this album and even though it s over years old the music still sounds brilliant like michael stipe of r e m said this album was several years ahead of its time label i m glad i didn t pay for it i received this as a christmas gift from a friend who knows i like hot tea all of the tea was some variation on flavors of green tea i avoid drinking caffein which green tea contains so i gave away all of the tea and kept the chest to fill with my own selections the chest is kind of cheap paper glued over something as described by another reviewer it s pretty but i don t expect it to hold up label great book this book gives a great look into the jewish mindset of the early s a must read for any young bible student label streisand live in concert cd s good this is a good double cd packed with alot of favorites i liked slot of her dialouges between songs her words messages are invaluble timeless il divo accompanies her on several songs like evergreen i would have preferred her to sing that one alone the music of the night somewhere not favorable with il divo label come on you have gotta be kidding ok first of all i was looking for lighthouse the classic pop rock group there was nothing to tell me that this album was a gospel cd ok i can live with that so i listen to my new lighthouse gospel cd let me tell you i was not impressed the engineering sucked the music was mmmmmmm ok i guess and the singing really had no feeling or substance behind it so if you are into gospel steer clean and if you are looking for lighthouse the classic pop rock group this is not it latter label misleading photo there was little information about the product other than the photo which showed the watchtower toys with action figures we thought that the action figures were included they were not also do not be fooled by the too good to be true price they charge so much for shipping it costs the same as you would pay in a store otherwise the package arrived in a timely manner was in good condition and appeared to be from a legitamate supplier label waste of money if you get to this review please please do not spend your hard earned money on this toy even at half price it is not worth it i faced the same problems as everyone else i m forced to use my own glue and take time out to re work the toy so that it does what it was supposed to out of the box a watse of money nuff said label what a waste after an hour of trying to put the tower together we gave up the legs kept falling off making the tower fall over and the lever did not make the doors open this was a major disapointment we returned it the next day in pieces label slick looking components are older technology keyboard sucks picked one of these up the other day mostly for the slick design and for the wireless keyboard with trackball type mouse controller but that s all it has is looks after using the keyboard it quickly became tedious to use since not only are the keys hard to push down they are in a tight proximity of each other and not in the usual places and the wireless is hit and miss possibly because it runs at only mhz frequency it will miss keys here and there so you have to type very slooow and check your work very often and with passwords where you can t see what you are typing good luck it quickly becomes a tire there is no number pad and the trackball mouse is skippy and lacks a scroll feature the processor is generations older than the current dual core intel processors and the ram is standard ddr instead of ddr2 unless hp updates the components and the keyboard this is a terrible value and a pos label confused i downloaded the sample and could barely get though the first chapter the authors writing felt very juvenile and kept mixing american with london slang honestly it was the dumbest book i ve tried to read in a long time at least download the sample first label great deliver of all products fast delivery of all products we just received the bunn coffee maker this is the fourth bunn coffee maker we have purchased over thirty years great product the book and the hair iron were gifts so we don t know how they were liked label romeo and juliet the tragic story romeo and juliet is the story of two young children who decided to live their forbidden love although their parents were terrible enemies because of this their lives ended with their tragic deaths making their families agree in what for years they were fighting for i like this story because it shows the bravery young people have without caring what adults say they should have thought this better so their wouldn t have ended in the tragic way they did both of them committing a tragic suicide this tragic also affected other lives such as their parents which suffered a lot for them label oh romeo stupid teenagers a boy who falls out of love as quickly as he falls in and poor communication shakespeare got teenage romance down pat label a good introduction to the tragedies romeo and juliet is a beautiful story and it is a marvellous play to introduce young people to the beauty of shakespeare who doesn t like to read or hear about star-crossed lovers who hasn t already heard the legend the play is easy to read as the plot moves along rapidly and it s beautifully written romeo and juliet are so tragic in their love and the silly feud between their two families is so destructive and senseless read it for the story but enjoy it for the beautiful prose label romeo and juliet we think that the book was a great influence to our english because it had a very difficult language so we had to look for the words all the time in the dictionary and that way we learn two things to look up words in the dictionary and new words we liked the end when all the main characters died it left me a great message if it wasn t for the video the school hired at the videoclub we hadn t understand it and the video is a bit boring also but we only liked it because leonardo di caprio acted as romeo in the video label good book but not this edition this is an excellent book but this edition is extremely poorly produced there are far too many typos and little information about the original publication of the book for example the layout is ugly it s great the book is cheap but i wish i had paid a little more for a nicer version label how do films like this get made if this isn t the worst movie i ve ever seen it certainly is in the running i would point out all the absurdities in the film but it would be much easier and less time consuming to just list the positives so here goes kevin sorbo while delivering a truly pathetic performance i swear he must have been drinking while filming this looked to be in fairly good shape that s it label what the heck the uniforms were ridiculous mixing ribbons and stripes on officer s uniforms the technical advisor should be fired i had to rewind the movie several times as it put me to sleep kevin sorbo puleeze don t get roped into making these bovine feces type movies again a real stinker label cute but a little cheap this is a nice costume but the material is quite cheap also it makes my bust look strange because the black part is right in the middle of it but the bottom part is really cute i love the polka dots on the inner layer of the skirt i just don t really like it myself i think it could be better label disappointed i m glad i read the reviews i agree if i can t choose my color i don t want to order there is another box very similar doesn t lock where i can choose my color that one i will order thanks for all your reviews label no color no buy i wanted very much to get a blue one for my grand-daughter but was afraid i d end up with black so a lost sale for this company sorry label not classic yello but very very good not everyone can like every album but for me one second is my all-time favorite i have listed to it regularly since it was first released and have never tired of the complex rhythms and musical variety that it offers one second is different from yello s other albums and in my opinion doesn t hold as much appeal for someone looking for pure techno while the drum machines and sequencers are certainly there and brilliantly done the sound is less annalog and has more feel it is not background music but rather must be listened to to be enjoyed the latin influence is wonderful and the music sounds as if it were made for shirley bassey s style and voice in my mind this album creates its own genre of music which i have yet to find elsewhere it is different but it is very very good label disappointed thrilled at my daughter s pregnancy i purchased this book for her because i could remember how much i admired it years ago when i read it her feedback mom it s really good until it gets to homosexuality it fails miserably there i just reread the passage on page of the library edition and now i want to throw it out of the public library s collection i won t i ll keep it for the good parts and try to forgive brigg s out-dated and misinformed attitude but i won t give it stars any more label a double edged sword this book is unlike most of the books written on the topic while nuel emmons seems to have started out with an eye on the ball to release new information on manson and the case against him he fell short of his goal by virtue of adding a lot of things which weren t really manson in his own words but were nothing more than fabrication label manson hates emmons watch charlie on video in an interview and hear for yourself him say emmons took his life and put that in my book then he took my life and wrote a second book with his name on it and said it was his life so he s milked you for two books he s a good crook the way charlie himself talks about the book indicates that less than percent is factual label lies lies lies for all of you who are under the illusion that this book is in charlie s own words you re mistaken at the time of the so called interviews the author was not allowed any sort of writing utensils tape recorders etc the words you see are those of the authors same old media hype to make a buck the author betrayed charlie by pretending to be his friend this is why charlie declines so many interviews everybody distorts everything he has ever said so my advice is if you want to read the authors take on charlie buy it if you want the truth don t buy it label really cmon now lets get real do you really think that this stuff is going to work especially the trapping so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work the lin lop sau the bong lop sau the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it but like bruce said man or for that matter any person man or woman is more important than any art or system even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around label i couldn t put it down nappily ever after was a true page turner i couldn t put it down venus was a down to earth character that i could relate too you wanted to know how the story turned out by the first chapter i was tempted to read the last chapter right after the first i look forward to more books by trisha r thomas i wish it could have went the other way but the author made it very believable label sadly predictable if you don t like to be surprised in the least bit this novel is for you if you don t mind the writer s technique or don t see literary language necessary to be entertaining then you too will like this book i on the other did not the plot was predictable the characters were one-dimensional and the language reminded me some what of mcmillan an unpolished mcmillan of course the best part of this book was the cover and that was just not enough to keep me satisfied label struggled through i struggled through this book the storyline was a bore i was also anxious to read this book as it was highly recommended but too was i disappointed if you absolutely have to read this book borrow it from someone or the library label klaatu hopeless i purchased the original klaatu album on vinyl in i love the album as much now on cd as it did then however hope is far too theatrical with virtually no actual songs on it if i could give it stars i would label a must read this book and author were interviewed on friday april by bill moyers on pbs fascinating the book is insightful and explains so much we in the west truly do not understand all government officials need to read this well written makes you think label a unique take on a classic theme i really enjoyed this book with the exception that the story was slightly disjointed at times there are sudden jumps in the story and one in particular in which a large chunk of plot seems to suddenly go missing aside from these short comings however the science plot work well together the characters are reasonably complex the universe captivating label one brave act changes a civilization this story is gripping in part because the female protagonists honestly feel they are making the best decisions that will affect the whole crew they are severely opposed to each others approach despite being close friends originally the act of the captain to pursue the fleeing object and thus stranding here crew forever inspires the entire human race to pursue a future in space and fulfill some aspect of a larger destiny that this comet takes them to the end of time and space has its own amazing affect on the crew there is a span of billions of years this book is about responsibility and living up to it including taking ownership for a vision and a mistake great read label great dali book great amazon price love the book love dealing with amazon com i ve been dealing with amazon for years now and have never had a problem with them thanks once again amazon label great space heater it swivels has a remote and a tipover safety feature and you can mount it on the wall if you desire it works wonderfully providing plenty of heat when you need it label thorough and interesting look at this most intriguing literary woman after watching the masterpiece theatre presentation of portrait of a marriage years ago i went on a search for more information about the life of vita sackville-west this bio was one of the gems overturned in that quest for treasure having only been able to find it in unca s library at the time i was delighted to be able to stumble over it again during a search at amazon com i have now made it a permanent addition to my extensive library of a subject i call the three v s the three v s are vita sackville-west violet trefusis and virginia woolf three women joined via literary and emotional attachment with vita sackville-west acting as the hinge label buyer beware if i d only read the reviews before purchasing this for my year old i would never have bought it it is very flimsy and top heavy the elevator gets stuck and it does take awhile to put together as i was driving all over town looking for the best price i wondered why no store had the batcave out on display once we got it together i realized why we ended up taking off the bottom poles and moving some of the parts around so it would stop falling over we have lots of batman toys and other mattel products this is by far the biggest disappointment in years of toy buying if it wasn t from santa it would be going back without a doubt buy anything else label this will be an additional toy for next spring s yard sale our almost year old couldn t wait to get this toy to add to his super hero collection it looks great on the box however this is by far the worst toy we have purchased for any of our kids in almost years it is so flimsy and cheaply built pieces fall off and it tips a lot hopefully it will be re-designed with sturdier materials if you are considering purchasing it don t you ll save your self some money and frustration label worst scanner i ve owned i was looking forward to a new scanner after my hp died after just a year i purchased this one based on the several good reviews on amazon and other sites now that i have the scanner i am sorely disappointed the picture quality is horrible no matter the tweaking i do in the scanner dialog the picture is faded and grainy the software itself is the least useful interface i ve ever worked with the auto buttons makes the image worse the image area recognition has never yet gotten it right and the most useful feature only applies if you are sending the scan to paperport something i never want to do label a childhood favorite in the greengage summer five english youths have their vacation trip to the battlefields of france derailed when their mother develops a disabling illness due to an insect bite while she is in hospital they stay at a hotel run by two sour proprietors and peopled by an eccentric cast of characters each of the youths pursues his or her interests painting photography etc while exploring the hotel and the grounds nearby they befriend the handyman paul a young man with a perplexing past and bond with their temporary guardian eliot whose background they eventually discover is even more disturbing in their summer stay the children also stumble upon a mystery as they collide with a foreign adult world they receive an education but not quite the one their mother originally intended label forget belkin look no further than the guf320 this thing was easy to intall i have a dual g4 mac no driver installations under panther if you re pre x on a mac you ll have to visit iogear s website for usb drivers you shouldn t have any problems using this card with a g5 given the bus supports pci cards either apple should just sell this card in their stores this is my first iogear product and this is the best combo firewire usb pci card currently on the market label great book for those of you who might think that a clavell novel might be a little too long for you this book is great and the shortest of the six books in the asian saga plus it stands out in its own right as a book that will leave an impression on you emotionally and as a result of reading a good book label most interesting ending this is an excellent book and of the clavell books i have read all except gai-jin this has the most interesting if not the best ending it seemed to me that clavell got slightly redundant with the natural disaster ending but he managed to avoid it in this book i found that the way the story and the character s individual stories were resolved or rather unresolved fit perfectly with the insanity that would be occurring in a wwii prison camp oh yeah the rest of the book is pretty cool too label afghan lovers unite this is a great new book from our friends at liesure arts i had so much fun looking at all the new patterns and color combos i recomment this book take it to the yarn store with you and pick a design and then your favorite colors and enjoy label complete nuisance i set it up according to the directions clicked the scan button and the contraption made a noise but never began the scanning process uninstalled it then re-installed it and the same thing happened complete and utter waste of my time i gave it one star only because it had all the parts in the box label bad company the scanner looks nice but very deceiving i bought this scanner because of the name xerox i had it for about months and scanned maybe sheets now it died xerox after weeks of calls now wants me to pay return shipping and they say i will get a refurbished unit bad company label does not work you get two sets of dice one that always comes up or11 and another set planned to have some family fun with it only fun we had was how it did not work at all the set comes up all kinds of numbers what were they thinking with this item label decent player while it lasts after a little over a year my zen xtra has stopped playing sound everything else works it just appears to be a faulty headphone jack which is a common problem on creative s players on a dinky portable i wouldn t expect much but on a device this is just unacceptable their warranty period and customer service is a joke go have a look at their forums stay away from creative products there are other alternatives out there label poor substitute for an ipod simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod even better ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap label yet another broken headphone jack after roughly a year of fairly reliable use i ve also fallen prey to the faulty headphone jack now i m wondering what to do with an item that i paid nearly because the limited warranty conveniently ran out eight or nine months ago limited being somewhat of an understatement no one should ever have to consider fixing and possibly further marring something they paid that much money for a month ago i would ve given this item four stars after coming here and seeing so many people with the exact same problem that creative continues to neglect i m outright angry that i m not alone label discontinued pd05500032 another reviewer recently advised that this is the model to look for i was just advised at a well known retailer that this model has been discontinued is this true or is this a classic bait-and-switch technique their current weekly sales circular features this model at a sale price when you get to the store they don t have it but when they look it up in their computer it shows up as discontinued it is difficult to relate reviews to actual products when the reviews you base your buying decision on could be about a different model s from the one you actually buy online or in-store the creative labs own website does not give model numbers so they are adding to the confusion label works great so far very simple and good looking coffee bean grinder pros compact size2 looks good3 easy to usecons i wish the cable was a bit longer2 the measurement for people coffee bean level is a bit hard to read i like to grind as few beans as possible since i am the only one drinking coffee at home and i have some trouble estimating how much to grind label great product the hands free is wonderful and it is much quieter than the push down button one we had before much easier to clean label design is flawed if you grind a lot of coffee over time you will realize that the rotation of the grinders is in the same direction as you slide the cover to remove it the result is that you will have to physically hold the top to the base when you grind beans after a little over four years the motor of the older model of this unit burned out i should have never gotten rid of my krups grinder label unevenly grinds beans this grinder does not work well if you use a french press to make coffee it grinds the beans very unevenly some large pieces and some very fine dust even on the percolator coarsest setting when you brew the coffee the fine dust goes right through the metal filter and ends up in your cup on the plus side it is easy to clean and maintain it may work fine if you use paper filters label unreliable first thing in the morning while i m still waking up and maybe a tad groggy the last thing i want is a finicky coffee grinder i bought this coffee grinder and used it daily for a few months when it started working only some of the time some days it would work righty off the bat and other days it had to be disassembled and cleaned and reassembled usually or times unplugging it every time for safety this added annoying minutes to the process of getting the first cup of coffee in the morning it got to be so annoying that i put the grinder away in the cabinet and bought a bag of pre-ground coffee when that ran out the coffee grinder came out of the cabinet again and this time it didn t work regardless of how many times it was cleaned and disassembled now i m in the market for a new coffee grinder label bought this grinder with great expectations it was supposed to do all the things my old grinder did and more i took it out of the box and nothing it didn t ever work period very disappointing is there a rating lower than one star if there was i would use it label not for arachnophobes the hobbit is no spiderman or battlefront the attacks are two buttons and the graphics are only ok but its just fun for the ride the hardest things in the game are not the villains but the adventure challenges you play as bilbo baggins through hobbiton through the dark goblin caves and troll caverns all the way to the dragon smaug the graphics are very in-your-face however being an arachnophobe i nearly fell off my chair when a spider jumped out at me i admit if you are into adventure games with a little more action i reccomend the lord of the rings games or the chronicles of narnia lion witch and wardrobe it doesn t have too much action especially at the beginning this is the perfect game to get into gaming with it s short and sweet and if you are a serious gamer get this for your pc as well label awesome i got this cd off amazon last christmas and it s something i ve listened to throughout the year i would highly recommend any music on the glass armonica and dean shostak certainly makes a go of it label tells the truth about the ukrainian genocide of the poles during world war ukrainian-fascist-nationalists the upa the so-called ukrainian insurgent army imitating the german nazis murdered over polish civilians in the most brutal manner imaginable after collaborating with the germans in the genocide against the jews in the ukrainian nationalists abandoned german service and formed genocidal bands directed at defenseless polish civilians children were impaled on stakes and adults were quartered etc this was no liberation of the ukraine as ukrainians had voluntarily co-existed with poles for centuries on territories which had possessed a mixture of poles and ukrainians for centuries if not from antiquity label love this show love this show so sad that the series is now over i have been watching since season and this show is one of my favorites i love parker and how quirky she is label great i love to watch this show it is funny as hell there is never a moment where i regret buying it label i hope they return the modern day robin hood s absolutely loved all the episodes each one of the group has their own speciality mostly learned using those gifts as criminals but now they are like modern day robin hood s they help those who can not help themselves in the way that is needed i love all the characters and have watched all seasons and will miss them terribly if they do not continue the series label my sides hurt after reading this i understand the point of this sting manuscript however all the serious stuff to the side this is the funniest thing i ve ever tried to read i could only take it a few pages at a time otherwise i started laughing so hard i couldn t focus on the page anyone who has ever thought about writing or publishign a book should pick up a copy of atlanta nights label kc light covers this item was misrepresented it shows in the picture that the letters are small but when we received them the kc letters took up the entire surface i was very disappointed as was my son when he opened them for christmas label seems to work and smells great i purchased this protective spray after i bought a curling wand i only used one other heat protective spray but i really like this one the other spray i used made my hair feel a little sticky but this spray is smooth and silky it smells great too label good price better than expensive okay so i have very fine blonde hair dyed and straightened curled whathaveyou every day i can t afford to not protect my breakable hear and i can t afford to buy the products from salons i am always trying different protectors and have had my way with fairly nice sprays what it comes down to once i adjusted to the way this and frankly most protectors are watery opposed to the hairspray-like salone protection i used its my go-to when i m low and dont have much money its about three to four dollars so i just stock up when i can and itll last me a fair while for the price and its effectablility i give it a five i would recommend this however there are better out there label makes my hair feel like straw i ve only bought this in stores not on amazon i don t care for it at all i prefer the straightening gel which of course is nowhere to be found in stores now label i love it it s cheap its good it works ive seen alot of youtubers use this product so i decided to give it a try it goes great though i think i love the dove better the dove one smelled better nd left my hair smooth not with this one though label empty bottle im soooo angry i am so upset i received the package wet it was not well close so i only got the bottle empty label light and no grease i was really skeptical about this product in the past i have used products like this and found that they tend to leave my hair heavy sticky and not manageable however i was really suprised by this product i used as the instructions said and some detangler and blow dried my hair it came out just as soft as it normally would have without anything in it but now i get the heat protection very impressed although i purchased this item at target for about so you can probably find it a little cheaper somewhere else label hated it wow not sure why so many good reviews for this it made my hair feel nasty and caked up i won t be purchasing again i guess everyone is different i have dry hair to begin with and this made it much worse with a very unnatural feel to it afterwards if you are going to buy i would look for the best price for only one bottle i got three bottles of this crap and most of it went down the sink so that it wasn t laying around in the crappy cosmetics abyss good luck label very dissapointed i normally am very pleased with sony products but this one has been very dissappointing it has in the middle of the night re-set itself to the wrong time on numerous occasions just this morning i fed the baby at what i thought was am it looked too light outside so i checked another clock and sure enough it was actually am my husband who normally wakes up at am was late for work this morning this has happened several times label not-radio controlled while the unit indicated strong signal it could not set the time automatically the reception here is very good and it is my third radio controlled clock the first one is from bulova and the second one is from la cross both of them work perfectly i spent hours on the phone with sony technical support but they could not figure out what was wrong very dissapointing label time resets to random times i ve had sony dream machines for years as my bed side clock and i was excited to buy this one what a mistake the time regularly just jumps to a random time in the middle of the night because of this i ve been late to work a few times i can not stress how disappointed i am or discourage people strongly enough not to buy this alarm clock label worst clock radio ever it s no surprise sony discontinued this item this is the worst clock radio i ve ever owned there are a number of problems with this item the radio-controlled clock-auto-adjust function does not work at all in my location all settings including time alarms and radio presets are lost whenever power is lost the display is difficult to read at a distance or at a slight angle label left me cold i was really looking for a book on how to use bluetooth and what the applications were this book is written for the geek and techno junky market and not the kind of person who wants to have the latest gadgets in their home and workplace i was really frustrated to read on and on about profiles what and technical data flow charts the screen shots were the most useful part of the book label fine in principle faulty in execution how and why the grail translation of the psalms found its way into the prayer of the church disconcerts me the rendering of psalm psalm in the douay-rheims bible for example is grievious striking at the heart of the church s prayer i e the psalms strikes at the heart of the church s belief the insipid modernization of the glory be and other traditional prayers has me scratching my head too who takes it upon themselves to even do this then publish it and disseminate it among the faithful anyway i eventually gave up on this volume out of frustration and began praying the psalms with the douay-rheims bible and the latin vulgate learning a little latin as i went on god willing i would soon like to get the latin breviary in addition due to similar dissatisfaction with icel s treatment of the liturgical texts i ve purchased the missal and begun to attend the tridentine massthanks be to god label beyond inspiring i cannot believe i am the first person to review this movie an overwhelming story of hope in spite of unbelievable sufferering and yet full of surprising humor i was afraid it would be dull and heart-breaking but i was surprised at the humor especially when the boys first come to the us their perspective on the us culture is very sobering and still hopeful everyone should see this movie especially young people what these men have been through is beyond inspiring it challenges me to make the most of my opportunities label this is the best they could assemble i read the first tale fruiting bodies by brian lumley and thought that was pretty good but i hope it isn t the best tale in the book unfortunately it was there are a few other good ones like foet by f paul wilson but there is also absolute rubbish like turbo-satan by christopher fowler two other hidden gems were wake-up call by david j schow and among the wolves by david case i advise anyone reading this to skip this book and instead buy any complete works by any of the authors praised above label dont buy from these people i purchased cans of this product and it came from tci i believe was the company five of the cans were completely hardened already and i sent two e-mails to them asking what to do about it with no reply beware buying from that company they have no customer service what so ever label more harmony books please jayne ann has been doing trilogies cranking out three books for a set of characters and outside her eclipse bay the first one is so good second two suck really however it s with her harmony books jayne ann really returns to her top form they are fresh funny and show she still have the magic so stop wasting time on junk and write were you show the same spark of romance and delight in the genre please these characters were so warm real sexy and loving what you other books are missing label pretty superficial examination of far right movement mr coppola seems significantly more concerned with promoting his own bravado for simply talking with those in the far right movement he provides no insight into how and why the movement survives basically a superficial and self-promoting book of little consequence don t waste your time and money label broken dishes ok thought after my last great deal this looked good too i stoped unpacking when i found a broken mug without pieces which means it was packed that way most likely a return and i would never have bought it at any price too huge to pack and return so i m going to give it to charity label pfaltzgraff winner beautiful everyday dishes that won t break your bank one hundred dollars bought service for people pfaltzgraff naturewood piece stoneware dinnerware set service for what a great birthday presant label soulful sweaty sweet southern stew minton sparks has cooked and conjured up a southern word-stew that does more than just paint pictures in your mind as you drink this concoction down you experience memories of place and family that if you are flesh and blood are real for you you don t have to be southern to understand this cd you just have to have lived among the species human because middlin sisters is for me about the essence the rue the drippings of joyful loving unvarnished god awful humanity from trella s trash to line up you ll think to yourself i know that person i ve been to that place that is my family if you ve ever had a drunk uncle or an aunt you adored or a grandmother with a switch in her hand you know middlin sisters no cd has ever made me feel like this one does minton sparks lord god this woman is alive and her gift is that she makes me remember that i am too label phil lives these phil ochs cd s are like life nowadays just keep listening to keep your soul and mind from drowning in the absurdity of the times it s music and poetry for the thinker that will face the pain and reality of being trapped in the situation of being fodder unit for the tyrants label smooth base for your makeup i m using this primer after switching to it from laura geller i find the mercier to be non-oily and it provides a good base for other face mkeup i wish it had a sunscreen in it though label laura mercier cosmetics after reading fabulous reviews about her cosmetics i decided to take the plung i purchased the primer moisturizing foundation and translucent powder personally they are not worth the and i returned them i actually looked worse and washed out it may work for some individuals but not me i am going back to my mary kay label on album number anita baker delivered yet another hit not as strong her first two previous releases but this held it s own and still proved that she was here to stay she had a billboard hit with the title track another billboard hit single with just because and the billboard smash lead me into love this project included the album favorite good love although this project only had tracks i m pretty sure it wasn t going to kill album sells by pulling a th single ehich could have been good love but when everything was said and done anita baker had another top selling gold album label jane austin would be outraged i found the story line of this book very tedious and unbelievable however that was not the worst of it there were so many places in the story where it seemed that the author must have been reading pride and prejudice as she was writing that it made the whole work ridiculous conversations and situations so mimicked austin s books that it bordered on plagiarism vert disappointing label breathtaking story for east and west believe me as soon as i move with the story of novel the irresistible force dragged the reader with such strength that reader forgets who has written the novel the major messages of this novel are to the western readers wonderfully affectionate mothers and ever lasting friendship across genders both tragedies and comedies overlook each other ultimately all the characters combine into an active group in the memory of vasavi go back to soil resounding what great tagore wrote lets go back to earth which took shape of developmental ngo pragati which is a dream in our life not unreasonably once started reading this novel one remains breathless till the novel ends the contour of the novel is never and no where flat rather full of ups and downs lovely twists and bents surely this novel will win hearts of many western readers who lack emotion about mother and friendship label how how how dare they it sadly possible to butcher an excellent musical so that it could be used only for torturing your enemies not one voice was correct especialy valjean so if you have an ounce of sanity please do not buy this label garbage cardwhat a waste this card was a waste of it won t do what most on-board sound cards do record a mix of streaming audio external audio if i record an external sound source then decide to record an internal sound coming from the pc i have to stop everything change a setting on the not close to being user friendly control panel the control panel in the manual is completly different than wha shows up in windows i am very disappointed in this and will return it what a waste label wasn t what they showed it to be what can i say the pictu bushing for the complete front end when it came just bushings for one spring label no go this works for me only if i take dots and it will only work for a few hours then it wears off i will keep the jar with me this semester and see if it helps on the go update later label excellent back yard solution we ve had this for almost a year it is completely trouble free we do set it up on a tile table because it is small and our cluless dog walked over it thankfully he was unhurt the unit puts out a nice amount of heat and extends the season we can sit outside it is simple and trouble free to light the cover screws down to keep rain out and the medium i think it is vermiculite in i haven t taken it camping but it would be easy to do so best money i ve spent in a while highly recommended label d wrong stuffsuper duper great product go for gold you re in it to win this is it and do it well buy this item words to fill the review woot woot label volumes as much as i love family guy i still can t understand this volume business thirty to forty dollars for half hour episodes is not acceptable smallville and battlestar galactica charge that much for entire seasons composed of one hour episodes for seasons one and three for bsg anyway since i still don t understand the and crap but i waited for the price to drop on those as well and on top of that the packaging of previous volumes has been done away with for the cheaper flip box if a premium price is going to be charged then i expect premium services so my complaint isn t the show which i still give five stars to but the price and packaging i did my usual thing of waiting and waiting and the price eventually came down but lets be serious shouldn t have to do that label fox is greedy first of all i love family guy from the day it premiered on fox but why can t they fox and i m sure seth has a hand in it too release all episodes per season on one volume like they did for volume season after that volumes are all episodes per volume at each greed is what i call it and in this economy its outrageous i don t know about you but i ll wait until it drops to or less before i ll buy it same goes for american dad oh and about the writer s strike just an excuse to only release the episodes per volume fox could have waited for the strike to be over and release full seasons per volume and the year the strike happened release that season and price it appropriately for the short fall of episodes label will the real peter please stand up straight so we finally come to find out that the dolt of an idiot peter p really is gay that explains a whole lot about the guy doesn t it label cd has bad quality i am not sure why one of the cds have bad color quality as if it is a pirate version everything else was great label pretty good it is a pretty good episode i have watched it a few times i never would have expected it out of a relative of quagmire label a pearl from a pulp shell i became familiar with this character totally by chance when the paperback collection was released in the s i was baited by the tag line calling him a supernatural sherlock holmes the stories are well written almost to the point of classic literature introducing characters with a taste for excitement a never-ending knowledge of the bizarre and an interesting sense of justice the corpse-master from the casebook of jules de grandin is an excellent example this who cares if a few of the stories were a little campy even those tales were fun to read since i bought the collection in the seventies i ve lost two of the volumes to acts of god but the four survivors have remained a treasured part of my library worthy of rereading several times label very talented i purchased this cd because of the song black but after receiving it i fell in love with the whole thing i had never heard of john but glad i have now very heartwarming songs label sports inflatables i thought they were a bargain for what i gave for them my kids loved them and had a blast sitting in them to play video games label not one of the better kw albums computer world transeurope autobahn even tour de france are well worth getting this one really disappointed me didn t have what kraftwerk is good at this was to overly polished and boring in my opinion some people may really like it label poor radio reception under the cabinet seems to only add more static sending this back right away my wife wanted this solely for the radio and her stations are static whereas my little clock radio seems to pic up the stations perfectly label a must for those wanting to grasp modern molecular biology this book is actually a readable text explaining many of the pioneering methods of molecular biology it does get quite technical but it does a fairly good job explaining difficult concepts with the help of illustrations i originally used this book as a text and keep it now as a reference when i need to recall details about a technique for those without any science background it may be a challenge but if you have the interest it would be a lot of fun the only bad thing about the book is that it really needs to be updated although i should note that most of the techniques described are in current use with only slight modifications label junk i have been using the pt1180 for a few years now the cartriges are expensive and they jam i have thrown away a few of them now worth about i like the look of the finished product but don t be fooled by an inexpensive intial cost factor a lot of wasted tape into your purchase label still trying to wash the stink off whew unlike the others below i hadn t seen ghost watcher one but was unlucky enough to pick this up at the library i think the only thing that works in this film looks like it was shot on video is the sound recording directing acting cinematography and story are all uniformly bad along with ridiculous makeup the dude below is one of the actors in the film as no sane person who would ever see this piece of excrement as anything other than a painfully low talented effort at filmmaking and what s with the towel over the bedroom door attention aspiring filmmakers you should watch this as inspiration that you don t need an academy award winning script to get your movie made it will make you feel like your francis ford coppola david lean and steven spielberg all rolled into one wish i could write more but i m still trying to get rid of the stench this video left label medicinal and smells like toothpaste i wanted to like this product based on some of the reviews but i just can t first it smells like colgate toothpaste and that s a no go for me with regard to a face balm secondly it s got a stinging quality that i do not experience in products like nivea for men or other shaving balms i ve purchased i want to be comfortable after i shave and apply balm not wincing in pain i ll finish using this product because it s tolerable but i won t buy it again label jury is in he loves it bought this as a stocking stuffer for the hubby two years ago now he cannot live without it this coming from a naval officer not a gq reader he says he loves the way it makes his skin feel after a shave he gets a cooling effect and he has noticeably fewer to no ingrown whiskers he also likes that it keeps his skin soft the scent dissipates very quickly he does not want to have a lingering aroma or smell like cheap aftershave i am putting some in my grown boys stockings this year i ll make junkies out of them too label it s not really fragrance fee i like the texture and the feel after applying the balm but it has a wierd smell and it s definitely not fargrance-free so folks who are particular in buying a fragrance free balm please be aware of this i also feel that its bit pricey compared to other non-alcohol based balms proraso musgo real etc label not necessarily a fan but this album is remarkable i saw they might be giants live and enjoyed the show and bought this album as a result i have no artists or styles to compare this to but it is eclectic and a bit strange with lots of variation in style and if you hear the same songs live they are even more so the musicianship visible on stage is something i have seen nowhere else label a true classic i just went to a tmbg concert in which they played flood in its entirety and was reminded what a great album it really is hot cha is probably the weakest song and it s not that bad and it s pretty much the only song i d even call weak this andfactory showroomare probably the only two tmbg albums that i would say are winners straight through although i haven t listened to their kids albums yet others like apollo or the else are a mix of hits and misses but these two just keep on delivering and of course this album contains birdhouse in your soul probably the single best song the johns have recorded if you re here because you ve bought their music for your kids and are curious what their adult music sounds like flood is absolutely the place to start label the best tmbg cd as of this compilation of they might be giants songs has all their best and most recognized hits the neccassary for the tmbg fan another great thing about flood is that this songs are so good that practically any alternitive rock fan could learn to love they might be giants through this album label doesnt stretch at all contrary to the dimensions given by some reviewers i found that you cannot stretch this cushion at all i tried stretching it over my headset and it immediately broke into pieces also the seller refused to give me a refund for the sameavoid trying to adapt this cushion to non-plantronics headsets label they fit they work there isn t much more i could say about these except they are a manufacturer s part and they work as designed label great great product great price star everything was an absolute pleasure doing business and i will be back for more purchases i highly recommend thanks a million label plantronics ear cushions they re just what i wanted no problems replacing the old ones comfortable on the ears and sound is good label grizzly plug cutters if you re looking for cheap this is the way to go they didn t get past the test phase in my shop i ll keep them though as a reminder of the non-quality products that grizzly sells i cannot believe they stay in business selling tools as such label great but really for the hard core fan i have several of the disc super expansion deluxe editions of his albums the original albums on disc are treasures but usually the second discs are outtakes and non-essential things that even hard core fans will rarely play if you find a really good price as i did for this buy it otherwise a good single disc remaster will probably be all that you want label good stuff i like this product i had to buy like dental floss though to get free shipping and save like and then they came separately packaged and on separate deliveries wish they d just raise the price label a huge hit at our house my family year old son included loves these cereals they are not quite as heavy as your typical granola not too sweet and the flavors are wonderful the amazon price is significantly less that if you purchase at your local supermarket and although they are still pricier than typical breakfast cereal i feel better about feeding them to my family label not as good value as i thought i liked the variety and the taste of granola overall i didn t like the vanilla and hawaiian but even those were not too bad my main problem were the bags are very small they are listed at oz but seemed smaller than that my family went through them very quickly at the current price and amount you get i don t think i would buy this again label navy seals in vietnam as if we don t have enough books about special forces in vietnam here is still another one dockery s writings do not have the flow and this short book takes longer than needed the reader gets information about some of the missions equipment and the brown water navy the navy seals did not contribute as much as the marines and army in vietnam still we get another book about special forces label no fun purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren this is boring and absolutely no fun no matter what your age i guess for almost you shouldn t expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting doesn t even deserve the one star i gave it label disappointed there was no description of how much video you can record with this camera i purchased this camera for the purpose of making videos and i also knew it took good pictures i wanted that feature also so i figured it said it takes video so if i had a big enough memory capacity it ll take bigger videos wrong it s a minute limit and i was never informed of this on amazon now i ve spent for practically nothing on top of that when i got this camera the battery kept dying even with a full charge so i had them send me another battery which kept dying on me the same one the last one did so i am very disappointed with how this turned out label warning this camera has a manufacturer defect this camera has a defect that wont let it recognize some sd cards but it doesnt show up until after you have taken some shots i took pictures on vacation then the camera went dead it turns out that there was a defect which you can read about on canon s website that causes all these cameras to malfunction until you download and install a patch buyer beware i lost all irreplaceable vacation pictures and you will too label beautiful i have always used epson perforated x6 photo paper to print photographs but since i just got the canon s9000 printer and started using the canon photo paper pro x6 borderless i ve been amazed compared to epson s paper the canon is the closest film developed on paper the canon paper is smooth shiny and the colors are vivid without the perforations the paper looks like it s developed professionally every package comes wrapped in a clear plastic sealed bag and inside are the sheets of photo paper along with a soft tissue paper to protect the first sheet and a hard cardboard on the back to keep the photos nice and flat the only problem is that the surface of the canon photo paper pro is that it s easily to scratch when rubbing against other paper or your fingernail it s not too noticable unless you look at it in an angle in the light but overall it s the best paper for x6 photos you want to print yourself great quality from canon i m not buying epson paper again label good safe it works well small and compact holds my xd tactical with a tactical light equipped nicely i do not like that it requires batteries and the buttons are very stiff buttons may loosen up with use label a great sturdy gun vault this gun vault was exactly what i needed nice quality construction easy to open with key or finger code easy to program new code etc i highly recommend this gun vault but advise you to carefully measure your handgun tip to tip and compare it to the inside dimensions of the vault common sense i know but give yourself some room to remove the handgun without banging it on the sides or under the lip of the sides or even having to finagle it out of the vault completely i intended to place a special revolver in it but the tip of grip to tip of barrel was just a tad too long so now i either buy a new smaller handgun or a bigger vault also there is not a volt battery included so you should have one ready so you can program your new code immediately it s a great gun vault i just didn t measure twice first label safe now opens itself very dangerous find something else length minsi ve had this for about years and just found today that it will open itself if i induce a little vibration by pushing it along my floor shocking and terrifying to say the least label great safe this is a great safe it is easy to program and the push buttons are easy to find in the dark with the indented finger positions it easily fits my revolver and extra rounds label code you have to enter a code by pushbuttons i dont recomend having to remember that in an emergency would suck i sent this back and got a handgun safe that scans your finger and opens backup key opener to much faster label inaccurate description product description indicated this is an audio cd when in fact it is a dvd so could not play it in the car label a true american original paul thorn caught me totally by surprise a few years ago as an opening act when he came out with only his guitar and voice and wrapped the whole room around his finger i caught him a couple of years later with his full band and it was a religious experience i have attended thousands of live shows starting in and i would put that show in my personal top this dvd with three solo songs and the rest with his amazing band comes as close to capturing that feeling as video possibly can the sound quality ranks with the finest concert recordings of all time paul has found the ultimate blend of rock blues gospel classic r b and country he and this band sound like no one you have ever heard and that s exceedingly rare anymore the dvd and bonus live cd are one the greatest values in recorded music you will ever find you need to see this man s band live but if you can t buy this dvd and crank it up billy rollings label make the photo i don t go anywhere with my digital camera without this and its lens it makes the photo the one thing that happens is you can t use the optical viewfinder for the conversion lens blocks it no big deal works just great for me label the quintessential cure album this is by far my favorite cure record it s the only cd that i own that i don t skip songs on everything flows the mood is never interrupted and the words conjure images as clear as photographs in the listener s mind the cure excel musically on this record as few bands ever will and the poignancy and wistfullness of robert smith s words is touching moving and exhilarating behind the tapestry of instrumental genius lies a raw emotion seldom found in rock music i recommend this cd to anyone who doesn t already own it this is one record that makes the listener participate in the artist s vision label do not order from hastings i d rate this zero stars if i could i ordered the cure disintegration on new vinyl i received a used cd when i called i was told i could return the item and they would expedite the correct item to me this is a christmas gift and i would now receive it after the th once i went to my email to print the return label there was a note saying they could not exchange the item and i would just have to return the incorrect item i am very upset with this poor customer service and such miscommunication now my boyfriend will not be receiving this item for christmas and hastings is refusing to send the correct item label garbage disintegration is right the cure were best when they did fun pop songs like in the s and early s pop songs are what gets played on radio and the radio is the only sure sign of what s good in music obviously this album doesn t get played on the radio i took a chance with this album thinking it would feature the fun rock side of robert smith alas it s totally boring rock i understand that the cure wanted to try their talented hands at ethereal rock or whatever but this stuff just drags on and on and on like a movie or something yes it s very cinematic cinematic with smith s mopey vocals which sound so much better when he s in a good mood and why wouldn t the guy be in a good mood he makes millions of dollars simply put this album is too long too brooding and too ambitious in scope for people in college only take care label amazing i bought this cd after losing the cassette years ago and the rediscovery of this music has been an emotional experience such beautiful music and lyrics greatly underappreciated by the popular music industry i can t get enough of this incredible cd label doris day fan i love doris day movies everything from pillow talk that touch of mink please don t eat the daisies send me no flowers do not disturb etc doris is by far one of the best in romantic comedies pair her with any leading man and she nails it rod taylor james garner david nivens cary grant and rock hudson having these guys as her better halves was tv couple-pairing at its best label this one is even worse than glass bottom boat doris day and rod taylor this one is the s dumb blonde pampered wife movie doris day is married to executive rod taylor he works all the timeshe hangs around the mansion with nothing to do except dress up a spectacular wardrobe is the third star i think this one is pretty bad except for her wardrobe stuff happens but most of it is drivelnot even worth mentioning i really do not understand all the rave reviews good is good bad is bad this one is bad label this cd had the right idea but somehow failed my interest in michael goes back to the mid s when he first went out on his own i have most of his cds and really enjoy his voice the concern i have for this cd as well as his other cds is material content michael usually does t choose the songs that i enjoy listening to he chooses a repertoire that is not necessary the big hits of yester year one thing i m certain of is that michaels voice always sounds good on all songs with the voice of michael on the so called great songs i think that he would have one great cd after another perhaps he should take my suggestion and try this new approach to song selection there s really nothing to loose and a lot of gain recommendation i can not recommend this cd label good stuff but the bible quizes and outlines are excellent but i have a problem with this book this book suggests that people should read from the new revised standard version bible which is known as the gender neutral bible some liberal churches use this for text during services it suggests reading from translations that have problems with them i am a person that is king james only label don t waist your money while the fire dancer is a great product it works great and we love it this fire pit for the fire dancer is complete garbage rarely have i felt so ripped off the cast plaster stones don t look even close to stone but i guess it s a good thing they aren t as there is nothing to hold them together aside from gravity and it might be even more annoying to put them back together after they fall apart from being slightly bumped i would also think as they are just cheap plaster casts one might actually be able to make them fit the product they were made to surround but they don t there s about a half inch gap all around where you can see through to the cheap legs the thing uses to prop up the fire dancer in the middle don t throw your money away don t buy this label javascript complete concepts and techniques i have been working with this book for several weeks now sorry to say the title is very misleading complete maybe in concept only the shelly cashman series is usually very good but the proofreaders were way overworked with this one there are several errors in the tutorials that make it very frustrating to use if you are just learning javascript i find the code testy enough without sloppy work on the writer editors proof-reader publishers s part i have spent hours to get the tutorials to work in some cases just having to cut bait folks at the publishers take this one home and try it out i m tempted to send you back my corrected book with the multiple errors that i have found fix the mistakes and try it again gentle readers this one is one to avoid label book was written for windows there are many complaints about this book but what people need to realize is that this book was based on someone coding java on a windows machine page shows the program list with some win programs now that most people are coding on windows how can this really be relevant they need an updated version that fits with computers we use today page shows ancient computers in a shopping cart i know the basics haven t changed much but come on saving on a floppy disk label great funglad it s a series i happened upon this series by accident and a lucky accident it was i ve been reading the books in order the series doesn t disappoint and i thought this book was the best so far there s an immaculate confection no it s not doug flutie with icing skullduggery in the vestry a maybe miracle and a developing romance in addition to the central mystery each book also contains the main character s wonderfully horrible raymond chandleresque novella the writing is clever and the language is an absolute joy and laugh-out-loud funny bar none the novellas have the very best awful mile-long similes ever written although much of the plot involves an episcopal church the story is neither preachy nor sacrilegious the plot moves along quickly the characters are likeable and the stories are great fun the price of the books is a steal i ll probably regret saying all this because the publisher will jack up the price be that as it may this is a fun read label can t get through it started reading jack london lately and really like his work this is way different from the london that i am used to reading very boring no excitement must be another side of jack london but i m not interested can t get past the the first four chapters don t think that i am going to try anymore either label check your camera manual first amazon lists this as the ac adapter for the canon powershot a510 but it is not the right one the voltage is wrong and the plug is to big my a510 manual lists the ack800 as the correct ac adapter so check your camera s manual to make sure this is the right one for you label hahaha very late review great working product indeed if you have a canon powershot you will need this ac device when you transfer pictures from camera to pc i had mine for almost two years and it works label cable is crap we plugged this cable into our midi board and the computer only received one out of every to notes we purchased a yamaha cable and everything worked fine but since we opened it they wont take it back and we are stuck with a useless cable label cracked i bought this is kiwi it cooks beautifully and cleans up like a dream too bad it cracked the third time is used it from the other reviews i see my experience is not unique label not a good substitute an employee at sephora recommended this conditioner to me as a replacement for my dr hauschka lip balm stick it was around the same price range so i bought it it leaves a white film over my lips and makes my lips peel however it isn t completely useless i use cauldie s lip conditioner to remove all the dead skin from my lips and then put my regular hauschka lip balm on now that i can find it at whole foods i won t be repurchasing this item it s a shame that i couldn t share a wonderful experience like everyone else had it just goes to show you product react differently on people label good for vocab and ideas this book is handy for those intermediate level spanish speakers who want to increase vocabulary about certain topics the ideas are not very sophisticated at all but it presents ideas from different perspectives and provides some decent vocab i ve been using it to prep for the foreign service spanish exam and it has proven helpful it doesn t cover enough abstract ideas for the level but it gives enough vocab and grammar to help you get there label great music i bought this for my song writer husband and we both love michael martin murphey the music was rally enjoyable and he is a good person to support he does a lot of work to preserve the cowboy way and land use policies in the west label fast shipping excellent condition great use for my school ager especially on those days he is without home work i definitely recommend using supplements in addition to the material they use school for superior grades label i have learned a great deal from this book i am currently in college taking pipe drafting courses we use this book as our textbook along with the accompaning workbook i find it to be very knowlegable and informative as well as well written it explains step by step how to draw your pipes manually using auto cad and pro-pipe as well illistrations are very good also my husband has been a welder for years and now he is also taking this course with me and agrees with my opinion this teaches you the basics of piping it is not an indepth book on the subject but for beginners it is outstanding i would highly recommend it to any one interested in the subject kathy noland label la la love it the pixies were so irresistably cool and catchy doolittle sounds like it was made in some intergalactic recording studio hurdling through the solar system who knows what the hell debaser is about but holy crap does it rock the rest of it is just so twisted and good it would be a crime to ignore it the pixies may have been the last truly fresh and original band to come out label surprisingly there are those that aren t familiar with this having always seemingly been compared to nirvana this does the pixies little justice as this their best album is a far more multi-tentacled beast than anything nirvana has done first track debaser is an ambitious accessible straight out the bag college rock track that is one of those tracks that anybody who s heard the album always mentions but it would be foolish to not equally praise their other exceptional tracks i bleed giving a gloomy take on ironic pop but its the irresistibility of here comes your man that invokes images of the velvet underground at their very best often bemused by peoples perception of their as a populist band singer frontman black francis quoted as saying everyone thinks the pixies were a incredibly popular band but we were just a cult band cult band or not they are one of the most consistently brilliant rock grunge albums bands ever devised label i would give this zero stars if i could i dont like the pixies at all but this is definatly their crowning acheivement label doolittle doolittle being the pixies nd studio album and their release and the critics loved it and allmusic and rolling stone magazine gave it max score i agree with them this is an incredible album two singles were released here comes your man and monkeys gone to heaven the booklet is quite strange but contains all the lyrics and has a list of whom and what they play on the album label pixies classic i really enjoy all the stuff pixies create and the songs of the classic doolittle are all high points in pixies career all the songs are great with the classics gouge away tame wave of mutilation debaser and monkey gone to heaven if you like nirvana you got to check doolittle label american dad season this show has easily become one of my favorite animated series ive watched in along time well written and the animation is fantastic the characters are unbelievably hilarious label fast shipping the book is fascinating and the shipping was incredibly fast received during the first week of class label so glad i found this i ve had this on cassette for years but about a month ago my old cassette player ate my cassette so i went on a search for the album on cd formatfound a new one for a lot of money so what a thrill to find it fulfilled by amazon at a great price for a used cd i ve never bought a used cd on line before but i trust amazon so i added it to my most recent order i am thrilled to have these songs back again i don t always like linda ronstadt but the songs on this album especially w aaron neville are awesome the actual cd case was slightly scratched but well worth it to save over and the cd itself looks plays like new thanks amazon label bad rheingold mastering i had looked forward to this set esp after the wonderful work archipel had done with their mastering of the knappertsbusch parsifal and meistersinger however the rheingold suffers from the same terrible remastering that afflicts their forza remastering on headphones the voices are all shoved over to one side with the orchestra on the other and there is artificial reverb added i understand the last three operas are better but i didn t bother a disappointment label if you love zelda if you love zelda this record is for you it s music directly from the game so if you want to learn the songs then its perfect if your a causual fan it is definitly not for you label this cd is awsome if you loved the music from the majora s mask game you ll love this cd it has every song in it totaling to tracks the only downside is it only runs through the song once other than this cd rocks if your a zelda fan this is a must buy label transform is dissapointing powerman s relase of transform is definatley one of the most dissapointing relases all the good stuff about pm5k the sci-fi themes space suits the nice vocals have all gone away and turned into just anothers simple alt band pm5k should have relased anyone for doomsday because we would have different to listen to that sounds like what pm5k should song like other than the amazing tonight the stars revolt i am pm5k fan and i hope they don t continue going down this road on the next albums label enjoy i purchased this album after hearing a song from it the songs in this album are both new to me and old classics all of the music is compelling and exciting you can listen dance or exercise to the music and none of the songs are boring or lacking in an rhythm that makes you want to move label doesn t work with cable tv this unit only works with directtv it does not allow you to integrate cable or air tv with the same system seems pointless if you want to be able to record multiple programs from both sources label don t buy when i bought the tivo set i thought it was great and really enjoyed all the features but now after just month the modem in the tivo set is broken which means it can t dial into the program guide etc anymore this means tivo is pretty much useless i thought this should be not a big deal until i found out what it costs to send in the set to philips plus shipping just to repair the modem i get a whole new set for that price besides the fact that philips seems to have a problem with their customer service the average hold time is minutes i tried it every day during the last weeks tivo is great if it works but the machine itself seems to have some mechanical problems that they need to fix before i will buy a set again if you buy it just buy it with a warranty label tivo changed our tv watching life the tivo is a terrific product that immediately changed the way my wife and i watch the tube we got the hour model setup was a bit time consuming and required a trip to radio shack for some additional cables but the instructions are detailed and easy to follow there are four or five shows we like to watch weekly and we are now free to see them at our leisure too tired to watch er or saturday night live need to go to a school meeting on wednesday night but don t want to miss west wing want to watch seinfeld reruns no problem watch them when you like and the pause feature is fantastic make yourself a sandwich take the call from your mother the show is waiting for you when you return we now rarely watch live tv because tivo has recorded other stuff we d rather see than the usual dreck you ll never need to watch another annoying commercial we love this thing great remote control too label evolve or dissolve to anybody who feels that metal should stay stagnant in their progress of their evolution should then stay with linkin park trapt or godsmack if you do you won t ever be disappointed for those of you who take great pride in watching some of your favorite bands take the next step in musical progress should then take a hardy bite out of this album coined with the category math metal by chad grey this band is as distant from nu-metal as tool or deftones as i have heard it described by some this album blends the raw vocals and unpredictable time signatures of ld50 with the melody of their follow up album the end of all things to come and then pushed the envelope a little more mudvayne is much more polished and for that i commend them and also for that they are a much superior band than they used to be so get your moving and pick up this album you won t be disappointed label world owes you recognition but you owe yourselves progress it s trite to re-interpret the title into the critique but i can t help regarding lost and found as all too fitting the best aspects seem like b-sides while the other two thirds remind the world why radio-potential metal has become so disposable and mudvayne is supposed to help us forget it s painful to imagine that they ve hit a creative wall worse to conceive that they would weaken themselves so as not to intimidate promoters but i hear those riffs that were worn out years ago and i just don t know the experimental sharpness is still floating around in here but it s measured with points rather than an edge gather the mob-funds guys but come back and remind us how much more you have to give label the smell made it unusable for me let me say that i m a john frieda fan i use the frizz-ease hair serum on my thick curly hair every day and it works wonders so i was prepared to like this product i m not very sensitive to product scents i will use most anything if it makes my hair look good this one is an exception though it smells terrible to my nose it s a combination of watermelon dead fish and baby powder and the smell does not go away as the product settles and dries i couldn t even give this a second test try because it smelled so bad it did make my hair shiny but there is no way i could possibly use it bummer i see that a couple other reviewers have liked it though so it s definitely a subjective matter and not everyone would find the smell so objectionable label tune out this book sorry but if you want to broadcast for more than a few feet this book is not for you this book is a collection of low-powered simple circuits backed with high-powered marketing the back cover states now that the fcc has changed the laws governing pirate radio and video stations while there is now a low-power fm service for which a type-accepted transmitter and license are still required there have been no changes governing pirate broadcasting it s still illegal and fun and there is nothing in this book that is going to save you thousands of dollars over commercial equipment while giving you the same power and performance these statements are clearly misleading and get your hopes up and your wallets out for something this book is not it s unfortunate that the author who is probably capable of doing so did not write a book to match the promised content label don t bother to be frank i found this trilogy so be the absolute worst book that i have ever read it was an omnibus the hero spent most of his time whining and making everyone else suffer along with him the writing was well done but the plot and characters were hopeless don t waste your time plowing through it label like wading thru cold maple syrup i will say that donaldson s settings and concept were unique at the time of this series s conception it might even be said that he revitalized an ailing genre with his well thought out epic but be warned this novel will leave intellectually spent covenant is perhaps the most indecisive whiny fantasy hero i ve ever read i find him thorougly dislikable he s the kind of guy you don t ask how ya doing because he ll take an hour telling exactly what s wrong with his life label didn t like it tried this book on a recommendation from my brother found it really stupid and kind of arrogant in the use of language like he was trying too hard to impress you with obscure words and i like to think i have a pretty good vocabulary kind of like he swallowed a thesaurus and borrowed other peoples stories besides read the whole thing but have no desire to read any more of the series main character too angry and couldn t seem to get over it wore me out label beware a hero that wines and is unsepathetic i read this book some years ago and just thinking about it to write this review pains me it s like trying to remember how it felt to have a stainless steel spike driven thru your skull the hero is annoying winey and while reading this book i longed for his death or disappearance the book is a slow hard read if your thing is reading about people you d never want to run into know and that s our hero then this book is for you how this book has had a run as a series of books is beyond me the story has no appeal to me i can t identify with the main character and it s a horrible read honestly i wish i had never read it you have been warned label a beautiful epic of tolkien proportions donaldson s thomas covenant books are masterworks of creative joy frustration and eventually triumph both the frustration and triumph stem from the intricacies of a complex anti-hero whom the reader will alternately want to curse and salute the first book lord foul s bane is not without flaws and it does begin slowly as others have noted but the committed reader will be rewarded with an epic of tolkien proportions and a world which is painful to depart once the last page is done i have returned to this series many times over the years and it holds a place of honor in my collection label first-class science fiction fantasy stephen donaldson s thomas covenant isthe only books i ve read three times a fantastic story with great depth if you like tolkein this is a must-read label great book received this book super fast which was great since i needed to read it for my class the book was in perfect condition label a great addition my experience with this book was certainly different from that of the reader above i loved the book i have referred to it many times and have tried many of the ideas i recommend it completely and i am plan on buying as soon as i can label wrong book i was sent the wrong book then he claimed he sent the right one that i never recieved he refunded my money but i am frustrated label an excellent album this is a great album there is a breadth of tone and subject matter though all the songs come from billy bragg s perspective and are quite political in nature to specifically address one criticism on this site billy did not write a new tune for the red flag he states that he is returning the lyrics to their original tune which is a lively irish reel the effect is to give the song the energy and enthusiam it requires label hymns to holocaust bragg has always been abysmal as a singer songwriter but recording the anthem of a political movement that killed millions around the globe is in bad tasteeven for pop music crank it up comrades and blast back to the era of the gulags that era you love so well label works with mac g5 works with a mac g5 drivers installed without problems the usb jack needs to be plugged in directly to the mac though or a powered usb hub otherwise the mac fails to see it running osx dual ghz i wish it came with a rack mount adapter instead of purchasing separately label everything but the sony cd clock radio almost has everything i was looking for a cd player easy use of both alarms the ability to set both alarms to the radio this sounds simple but many cd clock radios timex panasonic allow a sound source to be associated with only one of the alarms good sound very good looks but unlike most clock radios it does not have a battery backup as my area periodically gets short blackouts this is needed especially since getting to work depends upon it if you do not need the backup go for it otherwise look elsewhere label my first computer generated deck and i love it at first i was pretty sceptical when i saw some pics of it on aeclectic net but last year i discovered the german version of the deck at my local book shop and i fell immediately in love with it as i am a tarot reader and collector i have some decks and always refused incorporating a computer generated deck in my collection but i had to have this deck i use it for my personal readings and i am always amazed how it clicks with me i got some very interesting insights with this deck i also like the book as it tells about local british myths and lore but i would not recommend it for absolutely tarot newbies you have to have quite a bit of background knowledge label you re kidding right this music is very weak if you know your jazz then you will look to carla cookthe only max jazz artist worth your timebelieve me label not as good as i hoped although the product was definitely better quality than the valve i replaced it definitely did not provide flow shotuff it wasn t even close the remaining flow is significantly more than dripping and closer to a weak stream it does reduce the flow but certainly does not shut it off label works just fine easy to use and adjusts water supply as advertised as some complained it doesn t shut off completely but i really wouldn t want it to label how can people be so gullible in an year old girl did a science project in which experienced practitioners of ht were asked to detect her energy field and given a chance of guessing the results of the time the ht adepts were able to guess correctly a coin flip would generate approximately this is nothing but a scam and all scientific tests have proven this fact i would not waste cents on drivel like this if i could have given it zero stars i would label very good i really like this book and the threebook series in general lots of good puzzles big-enough type etc small easy to carry around take on trips etc receommend label worthless purchase i only give this a because i can t choose a zero whomever wrote the puzzles for this book obviously doesn t know the rules of sudoku no number can appear twice within a column row or box sub-section nor located in the same box within the box sub-section i m a sudoku fanatic so i m very versed in the rules when i sat down and started working the puzzles i found myself running up against instances on every puzzle where the same number would have to appear in the upper left hand box of each sub-section twice within the same puzzle which is a big no-no when this happened times in a row i went back to the answer page and discovered all of the puzzles had this defect do not purchase this book label sadly enough s enough this is the ultimate greil marcus parody by the master himself ideas like a solemn correlation between an elvis presley postage stamp and clinton s election are announced without even a smirk coming next knocked out loaded finding evidence of elvis and dylan in everything after falling down and hitting my head label delivery problem turned out great i added this item into an order at the last minute and forgot about it when i remembered it a few weeks later i sent a note to amazon about the missing item i was even concerned that i might have thrown it out with the packaging i have been organizing my supplies so there was only one place this would have been found in my garage amazon sent me the item now that i have it it is large enough that i know i did not misplace it or throw it out by mistake i want to compliment amazon on their customer service it gives me confidence to continue to order from them label the non-slip material sticks to soft leather i bought this to protect the soft leather in the acura tl i bought my wife the material they use on the seat facing side came off on the leather trying to clean it caused damaged to the leather could be due to high temperatures in california i would think the problem is less of an issue with thicker leather seats like the ones bmw uses but back seat of my acura tl is now in need of serious attention due to use of this product label deeply disappointing sooo glad i only rented it i was so disappointed with this film the acting was second rate at best the greatest offender being the scene with woman at the well john the ongoing interaction with the jewish leaders was utterly painful to watch i remember being so excited about this film i thought about buying it even before watching it so glad i only rented it believe me i had heard so many positive things about the film it made finally watching it even more disappointing mel gibson s the passion of the christ and the recent the nativity story are so superior in production value with the finest movie on the life of jesus christ remaining franco zeffirelli s jesus of nazareth i d certainly recommend these over the gospel of john label great video the best video concerning any gospel that i have ever seen stays strictly with what the gospel says and no personal interpretations label wow love the dvd henry c is perfect as jesus and the biblical account of john is spot on the bible no hollywood embellishments in this area the video leaves you feeling like you ve witnessed christ first hand and its very peaceful and satisfying buy this label what they don t tell you unfortunately this product was not labeled for use in the us only i cannot view the dvd in australia so buyer beware what a rip off i had to give it one star because the system would allow none label what better a witness then the word itself i like the movie because it is not common to see far straying from the word yet it is drawn from the alexandrian texts which are gnostic droping many words and even entire verses compare niv john to nkjv or kjv another thing isaih said the real lord was not comely handsom nor did he have any form was not well built also mary magdeline near the end gets a lot of camara time for some reason and keeps acting fluttery all in all i would watch it several times without feeling like i was wasting time because any of his words are enriching praise the lord jesus he has magnified his word above his name psalm b so then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of god romans jesus is alive he is risen he healed my broken heart and gave me a new life in him label the best this is the best jesus video i have ever seen in my life it comes in two dvd s the full length and a shorter one the man playing jesus was an actor on lost he does a truly inspired portrayal of christ and you have no problem relating to him label superb film this is the only biblical based movie that is actually accurate word-for-word to the holy scripture henry ian cusick is phenomenal as the messiah he is the best actor cast as jesus that i have ever seen the directing is amazing and christopher plummer as narrator is perfect i personally watch this movie on a regular basis it is truly the words of the gospel brought to life label wonderful i watch this often on quiet saturday afternoons it is one of my favorite depictions of the bible story i recommend it label how large or small is it i looked around the net and nobody gives the weight of this item i really love cheddar popcorn but will not buy an unknown quantity label i can t believe it came from memphis but then again i can this is a very pleasant collection of songs from a young memphian i can only call ultra-modern i live in memphis i know memphis is mostly about elvis sam and dave al green sam the sham carla and rufus thomas booker t and the mgs charlie rich otis redding and the bar-kays jerry lee lewis the three six mafia all sorts of rockabilly and soul and gutbucket and rap but this is really great too in a completely different way more like big star and alex chilton when he s not really angry and bitter this is ethereal and damn near giddy music it s intelligent rooted in s white pop with a carefully crafted psychedelic edge it floats along pulls you in and well it makes you feel happy it s ultra-modern nobody else sounds like this and it s very smart i can t wait for the follow-up i m the big oh and i gotta go label a virtuoso s best work the guy was a friggin magician on the guitar this disc covers so many styles but nonetheless remains tightly knit and cohesive country licks blues twang rockabilly jazz and the simpsons theme a superb recording serious fun deep shallow c mon and dig it label hillerman is getting better again i used to enjoy hillerman but the last few books before first eagle and fallen man left me feeling that he had run out of material well even if he s stealing stuff from john mcphee i really enjoyed fallen man and i think he s getting even better with first eagle i enjoy a good knotty plotline and both of these books deliver one more note quite frankly i never really could stand janet pete chee needs to stop moping and go after bernie label i eagerly anticipated this book and was disappointed this book was not up to the standards i have come to expect in tony hillerman s chee and leaphorn series the plot was convoluted and yet uninteresting and formulaic chee and leaphorn in previous books had appealing personal characteristics in this book all the characters were ho-hum label worst acting ever i m only minutes into this film and i m finding it hard to keep watching this is quite possibly the worst acting directing i ve ever seen in a movie label wow this album is absolutely amazing you can listen to the first ten seconds of donna lee right from the opening hit of the drums through to the beauty of forgotten love and realize this is some pretty hot stuff best tracks are continuum portrait of tracy okonkole y trompa and forgotten love kuru speak like a child ain t bad either the bonus tracks are alright but the general album is more interesting in my opinion one of the most accomplished works by one of the most accomplished if not the accomplished player of all time label i dig this i knew what i was getting when i picked this up pretty much your standard random-members-band with random vocalists and paul di anno the man himself from the first two maiden albums this is good not absolutely earth-shattering but that s not the point of these things as they are tributes by artists who love the band i gotta say that so far the steve grimmett tracks have to be my favorites he even comes close to bruce dickinson s greatness at times di anno s while great seem to be lacking something in the delivery but that just might be the fact that he s older than he was when he originally recorded them then there s bernie shaw singing fear of the dark which was great to me because i m a huge uriah heep fan and he definitely brings some of that spirit to the song all in all a pretty standard tribute definitely recommended to all maiden fans label buyers beware even though these filters are identified as skuttle filter part they are not manufactured by skuttle genuine skuttle filters have pleats these generic filters only have label good for heel spurs this is the second pair i ve bought i have heel spurs on both feet and these shoes are soft enough on the back to not put a strain on the spurs i use them for work and they hold up to the hours i m on my feet i placed my orthotics on top of the insole so thay might be why the navy color looks drab grey after washing so i don t recommend that color and i haven t washed the glossy black i have yet i may not wash them because they can be wiped clean label wish i had kept the box to return them in these shoes run large and are not as comfortable as described i wouldn t dare wear these for work they are large loose in height and length but still narrow in the front just behind the toe box i ve bought much better much more comfortable footwear for less money than these shoes cost i like the color and texture of the material but don t know how they will look feel after washing they look ok but they feel cheap on my feet and i won t buy another pair i wish i had returned them but thought that if i bought better insoles they would be comfortable but they really aren t and i have to wear extra thick socks with these although i still need to stretch them behind the toe boxes i regret that i threw out the box and cannot return them they are a waste of my money label a great show i love law and order and will purchase all seasons at some point the rip from the headlines stories are so true i love the show and hope you do too label disappointed sorry to say that i m disappointed with these headphones i have purchased headphones from v-moda three times before and they ve been awesome but these latest headphones the cord is cheap and gets tangled very easily very irritating i do not recommend label great sound but poor durability rich highs and deep lows sound great but not if the cables fall out of the buds after weeks of routine use ahhhhhhhhhhh label epidemic lack of quality please read the reviews before buying these headphones look great and sound quality is great but mine lost sound in the left ear after weeks that is completely unacceptable i wish i had read the reviews before buying apparently this happens with great frequency save and much aggravation and check out the sony fontopia s those lasted me a year which prior to this was dissapointing i spent the extra money for increased durability and was completely wrong you don t get what you pay for avoid v-moda like the plague label for their price these are a great deal the v-moda vibes are a nice little set of headphones i use them with my creative zen and they sound great they don t sound quite as good as the higher end ultimate ears or shure but good for the money they are a tiny bit thin on the bass but better than most in their price range if you need more bass check out the v-moda bass respone phones they do need a burn-in period though to reach their capability label scratchy scratchy scratch scratch okay so i had pretty high expectations for this product because of the many reviews it got and how awesome these looked it was very deceiving when i got home and popped these out plugged them in i was sooo disappointed with the highs on in the headphones it was very scratchy every time something not even that high would be playing the lows were good but they do not make up for the highs do not buy these headphones unless you only listen to music with just lows label amazing for about months when i first received them they sounded amazing loved every bit of them from their looks to the sound i used it fairly actively ran a lot with it walked everywhere with them on etc now first thing to go was the metal sleeve on the connector it was sliding off and whatever no big deal this happened about a month in then the next thing to go was my left ear buds insulating wire exposing it slowly still worked fine but it was slowly dieing then near the connector the insulation broke there too exposing the wire then the right earbud s wire was exposed then the left one stopped working altogether that s when i got new earbudsoverall i wouldn t buy these again almost got tempted since i noticed it had a different design on the connector so i thought maybe they got better but this time i m gonna heed other peoples reviews and still not get them label they didn t even last me two months i bought these on june and they gave out on me two nights ago august one of the ears just up and stopped working i have to constantly adjust the wiring just so that the dead ear bud can come back what s the point of this high grade wire protector if they re just going to give out anyway and at i expected much more from this far more at least a year if they had lasted me at least a year then i d at least be satisfied with my purchase but sadly that was not the case cheap non-name brand ear buds from cvs lasted me longer than these things avoid these people lest you want to suffer the same frustration i experienced i m going to try and see if i can t get a new or refurbished pair from the manufacturer this shoddy overpriced merchandise cannot go on like this label good sound bad quality i bought the red version of these earbuds in january after tons of research a lot of the negative reviews i read were about the earbuds shorting out in my case after about months i noticed that the left earbud was now playing at a much reduced volume at first i thought it was just the stereo mixing of music but then i realized that indeed the volume and bass coming from the left ear bud was very quiet and now it annoys me to listen to a couple of months in and i m sol especially since i bought them for on amazon without a warranty splurge for buying them from the manufacturer so you can get them repaired pros sounds good look great easy to get in and out of ears compared to shure cons they are already shorted label very nice i was searching for some ear buds to replace the standard ipod issue i got a pair of shure e2c s for xmas and have never been able to get them to fit my ears no matter what fitting i used after much experimentation i was able to get some of the foam fittings to work but the sound was still lacking no bass at all after doing some reading i decided to take a chance on the v-moda vibes at first i was a little concerned they might be to bassie well that is not the case the bass is definitley there but it s not overwhelming by any means so far i like the v-modas a lot i was able to wear them right out of the box i haven t even tried any of the other fittings plus they re not as clunky as the shures the smaller size enables me to fit almost the entire bud in my ear i am quite pleased with my purchase anyone interested in a slightly used pair of e2c s label great sound poor durability first of all these earbuds sound great however after only six months the wire near the earbuds started to tear away i sent them back for a new pair almost a month ago and they still have not shipped the new pair great sound but poor durability and terrible customer service label extra noise one of the worst purchases i have made the cords to the earbuds are fabric covered and rub against clothing creating load rubbing background noise that is high decibel and louder than the music being delivered i have to binder clip them to my collar to get them to be acceptible hate them label great sound but be sure to save receipt title says it all left channel bud started to fade after months of use never used earphones with ipod in pocket so bending of cord was unlikely cause of fault that said vmoda stood behind their product and provided a quick exchange via mail with proof of purchase big picture tremendous value and sound earbuds are great for passive noise reduction of piped guido music at health club and aircraft noise label better than average while they look excellent being metal and shiny it all comes to soundthey are a type of sound that is very smooth laid back yet detailed they also have excellent low end bass not boomy or bassy but deep amd large there is no listener fatigue from extendid listening of the music the only fault i could place is a slight lack of brightness i am used to so key words here are smooth detailed laid back good bass label ftoo ragile the voice from right-hand earbud becomes much lower than the other month after i got it label v-moda vibe earbuds i have used earbuds and headphones extensively for years i found these to be well made sized well and comfortable the sound quality is good but so bass bias it sounded very unnatural listening to my ipod i returned them to amazon and received a prompt refund label good buds good base i dont feel they are base heavy the only problems i have i lost the carrying case with the replacement tips along with it you can hear the cable moving around when you are wearing them i want to try the foam tips they sell but they are a bit expensive they bothered me at first because i wasnt used to having the buds in the canal u get used to it i would try a different brand for my next pair label good sound but not as noise insulating as i hoped i bought these primarily to use on my commute i had read they were great at insulating outside noise i ride a very noisy public transit train in the sf bay area and these earbuds really don t block out enough sound the train wheels just scream on the tracks in some sectinos these are comfortable and the sound quality of the music is good but if you are looking for something to insulate outside noise these won t really do it label great looks sub-par performance i purchased these headphones twice the first time was in summer the headphones were awesome however they crapped out after about two months i returned them and went with a cheaper set of headphones i was craving some nice headphones and i saw the price on these is substantially down from so i bought them again spring big difference the external looks are the same but build quality is down and the sound quality and in-ear comfort is way down these are headed back to amazon for a refund label great purchase we recently purchased a touch free trach can thru amazon the product is great it is easy to use and you don t touch the trash can a wonderful product the price was outstanding we had priced similar products upwards of we were able to geet the trach can thru amazon for less than label works great but the touchless operation of this trash can works great easy to attach and remove trash bag and secure ring to keep bag in place but the sensor that raises the lid is too wide of range walk by within ft and lid opens runs battery down quickly have gotten in habit of turning off except will doing food prep for period of time the function of no touch use was what i was looking forward to turning on off for most of daily use defeats the no touch perk label useless i hate spending money on bad products and this was a bad product my husband and i used it for a couple months and it already broke we sent it to the factory for repair but the same problem happened again after a few months now we don t even use it label a mind of its own after five months of use it was alright at first now the lid will open at its own will or not at all even two set of new batteries were changed label best trash can ever this trash can was purchased to replace a round stainless steel trash can not only did it meet our expectations but they were exceeded the hands-free mechanism works extremely well and the can holds more than we ever imagined the fact that odors stay inside is an added bonus worth every penny label so far so good this trash can is classy looking matches well into a stainless black kitchen and so far one month in has worked great the size is just right for a kitchen the sensor takes about seconds to register before opening the lid while i d prefer a little more immediate response but oh well overall a very cool addition to my kitchen if it goes bad i ll come back and update the review label electrical problem the itouchless trashcan you sent me had some electrical problem both powerr sources batteries and ac adapter did not work power did not come to the trashcan i mail to the customer care but i was told that a warranty does not apply to japan at present i am using the trash can without power label this garbage can is garbage length minslook this thing doesn t work anymore this claim if you open your can times a day it can last over years this could actually be the last trashcan you ever buy which will save you money mess and time is an outright lie this garbage can lid worked for about months at best it no longer opens wide enough to put trash in and the lid only stays up for a second if that totally useless overpriced terrible product label the lid stopped working within months after comparing step cans and prices at wal-mart kohls amazon and ebay i found this can for at costco and went for it we all loved it it was so convenient the infrared sensor was iffy sometimes it doesn t respond but i had no problem pushing the open button which worked fine to me after months though the lid won t open either with the open button or the infrared sensor fresh batteries notwithstanding i have to dig my fingernail under the lid to open it sure the close button still works but shouldn t i expect that my garbage can should outlive my garbage thank goodness i bought this at costco i can return it for a full refund even after months i m going to get a reliable and durable step can and skip the of batteries altogether good idea but unreliable technology makes this a loser in the end label saves clean up and time i have found this trash can to be a real time saver first it has a large opening which prevents spills and other messes secondly because it opens automatically i spill less and do not dirty the can by touching it constantly i have had one for two months and am pleased with the performance use regular kitchen bags getting the kitchen bags in isn t the simplest task but it does hold the bag in well cleans easily i would recommend label what s up with this sensor it s interesting that we have recently started experiencing the same problems that others are commenting on our sensor has stopped working all together we have done everything that others say works replacing batteries unplugging the cord which we had to buy separately and cleaning where the sensor is located yet this trash can will not work if you are looking at purchasing this item please please read all the comments here first this device has a very short lifespan typically a month label don t waste your money bought this last week i m really not sure how this product gets stars from others it s a piece of junk right out of the box the lid does not close all of the way i wind up having to press the close button several times i ve tried the leave the batteries out trick to no avail don t waste your money and don t believe the other positive reviews this product is well trash label touchless stainless trash can i have had this trash can for years absolutely amazing it finally died after years of everyday use highly recommend loved it no problems whatsoever label stainless steel garbage i purchased this garbage one because i wanted the largest sized stainless steel garbage i could find and two i wanted one that looked good with this product i received the best of both worlds i enjoy everything about this product it holds a lot it looks great and its motioned sensor opening lid is awesome this product is by far worth every cent i spent on it i highly recommend it to anyone its overall an excellent product no complaints here label worked ok for a while and then it stopped working it never opens or closes properly contact customer support days after warranty ended and they refused to replace label tech home i m an electrical engineer and just bought a new home so i m trying to tech it out this is a great trash can that s perfect in size and function everything is working great so far and whenever my friends come over to my place they love to play with it label worth for the money my wife saw the review and arranged to get this for our lovely new home when i unpacked the trash can i felt it was so thin and weightless slowly i realised that we do not need really a heavy one for this it is so far working well and feel the importance of touchless we had house warming few days ago and everyone who came to the house warming asked where did you buy this we have two kids we thought they may play with it but not at all the negative aspect of the touchless is to sensitive even if you walk near by your dress make them to open many time and secondly i feel the time limit of lid opening bit shorter but these two negative aspect are very minor problem i would strongly reccommend this trash can to anybody label everybody should own one of these this is the greatest thing ever the process to change out bags is slightly more involved than with our old garbage can but this removes so many other minor inconveniences regarding trashing things it s hardly a worry bag never falls into the can perfect size for the kitchen and even looks great can t imagine finding a better item at a better price label best product on market i bought this as a gift and was told it was the best gift they had ever recieved and uses it daily and recommended it to others i bought myself one and was so pleased as to how long the batteries lasted and how well it works a real attention getter for company everyone loves it label canadians do not order i thought this would be a novel product to have in my kitchen i was thrilled when i ordered it trash can arrived by ups and they charged me a brokerage fee to bring it into canada when i got it home it did not work i sent it back ups and it cost me in shipping todays concept gave me a real hassel with the return i never got my monies back for brokerage fees and the cost to ship it back i am out over on this transaction canadians live and learn label ok until something happens customer service blows this trashcan worked great for the first day then it kept staying open got tech support that didn t fix the issue was told to mail it in after mailing it in on dec th they said that it was take about weeks after arrival before mailing it back to me well it is now feb i have called times and spoked w angela who keeps saying it is being mailed on this date or that oh it s sitting in receiving and will be sent today oh were looking into it and so on will i get it back or won t i oh and no one will claim to be the supervisor go ahead call them yourselves you ll see isn t it pretty bad when they know of x number of customers by name label sensitive sensor solution not sure if anyone else has posted this solution all you have to do is cover part of the sensor with black electric tape the more you cover the closer your hand needs to be for the lid to open overall a great trash can only negative besides the overly sensitive sensor is the stainless steel is a bit too thin label good quality product with great look this is a great looking trash can that works very well i have had the trash can for a long time about a year it still has the same batteries and doesn t show any size of failing this trash can is not a bullet proof tank but it is strong enough to hold all the beer bottle you can fit in it like any sheet metal product it will bend if you mistreat it label almost the perfect trash can of course everyone thinks you are crazy for purchasing a hands free trash can but my husband and i really liked the idea much more sanitary the trash can arrived in good condition easy to operate once you get the hang of putting in the trash liner which is not really that difficult but you have to make sure the inner ring is in the correct position looks clean and neat space saving the reason we didn t give it a star rating is i couldn t figure out how to give it stars the lid sometimes goes up when you walk close to it not a real big problem for us but if you had a large family it might and it would have been really good to have the choice of an adapter so that it could be plugged in not real draw backs and none of these have really been a problem but items worth noting i would order again and have recommended to friends even those who laughed my husband and i both love it label kitchen automated trash can awesome just could be upgraded by one feature if you through stuff eg empty coke can towards the lid it should open on time otherwise it s awesome and i recommended to allof my friends they purchased alreslady it label decent but lacking basic supplies works fine but not designed for all gallon trash bags furthermore i was more than a little surprised when the package came without an ac adapter those things cost cents to make and for a dollar trash can one should have come standard label lasted about months well it was great for the first or months then the door started opening slower and stopped at about half way now-a-days the door only opens of the way when this first started my first thought was to change the batteries when that didn t work i thought it was due to the batteries being old so i went and bought new d size batteries they weren t the cheap dollar store batteries i bought energizer batteries just to make sure that they would be full power sadly this has not worked either so months ago this trash can was a star now it is a star unfortunately i expect products to last at least a year before i replace them this was a waste of money for the trash can dollars and batteries dollars the next one i m going to buy will be a step trash can label not2pleased i previously owned an automatic trash can and loved it unfortunately it was broken in a move i haved looked everywhere for a new one and decided to try amazon com i did find them and tried to get the same kind but got as close as possible i was at first very pleased with the product but within a few days the rim kept falling inside the can the batteries kept falling out because the battery cover was not secure ended up exchanging the whole can to try it again i feel this could be a excellent product if the battery compartment were on the back of the lid inside of underneath thats the way my previous trash can was made label the battery cover didn t fit i could no way close the battery cover so i duck-taped it to hold the baerries but the batteries were too heavy and they became loose and pushed the cover down into the can this apparently happened when i emptied the can for the first time i ordered this on sometime after that i realized it stopped working and found that the cover was permanently lost to the town dump i duck-taped the batteries directly into the slot but after a few hours maybe a few minutes the tape could no longer hold the heavy weight of d-batteries and became loose so the trash can is totally useless had i bought this from costco i would take it to the store and they would refund me but unfortunately i bought it through amazon com i had also threw away the box i ll just have to throw this trash can into my trash bin to go to the town trash tump what a trash product it is if amazon com keeps selling products like this it will become a trash company as well label lid does not fit can been using this can for well over a few months now and am now getting around to writing the review when i first opened this trash can the lid did not fit the can without an extreme amount of force every single time i change the trash bag i have to literally fight to get the lid back on also this trash can eats batteries like a fat kid eats cake fast and often do not get this trash can label better than expected i purchased this really hoping it wasn t just a gimmick and it wasn t it works beautifully keeps the dog out and was worth every penny label finally a trash can that can do tricks i really like this trash can it automatically opens when you want it to then shuts a few seconds later i ve only had a problem if i accidentally turn off the power switch in back i ve replaced the batteries only to discover the switch was turned off my favorite thing about this trash can however is when guests come over stand in front of the trash can and pretend it s your pet say who wants a treat and after a few seconds get close enough so your hand trips the infrared and then toss the garbage in good boy label over priced touchless trash can i ordered this product paid plus for the item i found the same identical item for at sams club the plastic gear that controls the lid is way under engineered it came apart in less than a year this destroyed the touchless qualitytouch-free stainless steel gallon trash can label nice concept but poor build quality i received the trash can with several dents on its side probably due to shipping after examining the material it was made of i concluded that the metal was very thin and flimsy the dents caused the retainer ring to no longer fit properly in the can i can say that the lid opening mechanism was very smooth and functional but the poor build quality of the can itself is why i m returning it label too expensive to only work for a year i m so sick of these fancy expensive metal things where the crucial mechanism in this case the hinge that opens the lid relies on a tiny piece of flimsy plastic that breaks this is a beautiful trash can that i liked while it worked but the little plastic hinge broke and now it s garbage i ve had the same problem with pedal cans the whole can is stainless steel except for the part that should be and that part inevitably breaks and leaves me with a useless piece of junk grrrr label love the product i purchased this product two years ago and love it however there is one issue with it as other reviewers stated the mechanism that lets the lid open and close broke off after one year however my husband was able to repair it by using super glue this method worked two more times now that trash can is two years old we can no longer repair it we are now purchasing our second itouchless trash can i hope that they will think about selling the replacement for that mechanism so that when it breaks again we can purchase the part needed instead of the whole product label gal touchless buyer beware-the engineering is just terrible the plastic gear that operates the lid is too small and broke early on the battery compartment opens to the trash hence when the battery lid fails the lid and the batteries go out with the trash touchless sent me a new battery lid plus shipping it smartly went out with the trash as well after juryrigging the battery compartment with tape it worked for one more day then gave up the ghost and died i now have a toy that doesn t work and only did work for a total of weeks label time tested we have had ours for years it has served as our kitchen trash can in a busy home i am back to buy another my fault i broke it mine is in an area where people see it as they walk in it is sharp-looking and free of bag overhang my pets are not tempted to pull out trash since it is always contained it has never malfunctioned the only precautions i would pass along are that it is easy to mistakenly dispose of the big plastic ring that hold the liner when one is taking out the trash and the plastic sheet covering the battery-pack fell off once and was carried away to the outside trash i really hesitated when i purchased it but it turned out to be well worth it label great product love this trash can works exactly as stated small enough to fit where i want and large inside have had no problems to date label i like it works for me so far before i bought this i read most of the reviews positive and negative most of them are true so far i am happy with it label great trash can a great kitchen trash can opens immediately sleek design and great capacity push the button to the right and the top stays open when you have your hands full of veggie peelings my husband does not like the ring inside the can which hold the bag in place he says its too timing consuming to replace the trash bag overall its one of the better trash cans i have ever used in the kitchen label love it i really love my new auto trashcan i use it for recycling and it is quite busy and works perfectly label perfect trash can we purchased this trash can over a year ago we really like it works very well looks great fits nicely in a narrow space we changed the batteries after a year i would highly recommend this product label love this group these guys are professionals and just totally great at what they do they are truly world-class musicians and can adapt to any sound if you haven t heard any of their music it is safe to say that you can pick up and cd of theirs and start listening and enjoying the music label satisfied user i bought this part to replace a damaged unit on my sons mountain bike this deraileur is the same make and model as the damaged one it was delivered as described in the original packaging in quick time easy to install and adjust full instructions included works just as it should label charm city s up coming this cd has six good tracks but the one for the ladies is number s saying i love you label if you feel this album then just get it dam music i played back in while in th grade is like old school rap classics now i like this albume still today in dare i say it but it s a fun album i mean i know hip-hop now you got to be a thug and all this album just brings back good memories for me back in a time in th and th grade early s the beats on this album still play to me and aren t out dated for example i brought ice cubs the predator album just for the check yo self track but all the other song beats on that album are mad out dated i don t know if your a young cat reading this or someone like me around but this lp is just that good stuff if you weren t around in you might not be feeling me but tracks for example feminat fatt sobb story show me a hero were just my songs along with many more on this lp i don t know i just feel those good beats and the creativty on this album still today label don t need to be a plant expert although i very much enjoy books that simply educate me about certain plants i am not able to remember all i need to know in a regular timely fashion this book with its month to month format overcomes that by reminding me to weed-n-feed my lawn prune my summer flowering shrubs plant bare root roses and spray my fruit trees all in one chapter entitled march also great reading and pictures along with my southern living garden problem solver book i don t need any other gardening books label poor quality and pretty worthless the box was a warning it was cheap and not even square the bits would not fit into the sockets so it was nonfunctional i sent it back for a refund label good instrument this has many available choices for watch backs the watch back must have slots it is very easy to adjust and removes the back without any problems in time the cost of this item will save money in taking your watch to a jeweler to have the battery replaced label a little small for a inch pan i bought this pan for thanksgiving for making a particular dessert recipe that required a inch square pan i read the reviews here and knew it might be too small and it was but i thought it was so pretty that i could use it for other things if not for the dessert dish it really is a beautiful pan but the one i received has a sort of pinkish tinge to the beige i have other lecreuset products and none of them look quite like this it s still pretty though and heats up well for cooking label buy this one for one of the best song ever written caruso there are three songs on this cd if you have seen the pbs special you like me were blown away by the powerful performance she took this beautiful compelling song that her mother used to sing and brought it to a new level andrea bocelli s and pavarotti s version of caruso are no where as fulfulling as the emotionally packed exquisitely crafted masterpiece this song is reforged timeless like she says when you heard her interpretation of this song you see feel breath touch the culture soul history and essence of italy not a breath was wasted every nuance tone blend of emotions fell into place i hope when upon listening this song for the very first time you will be lifted and transported to another place and time it is truly an unreal experience furthermore italian is truly a beautiful expressive language i bid you love and peace label contains bad assumptions and poor worldview i have a few problems with the dvd it assumes that co2 is causing global warming something that is not scientifically proven global temperatures peaked in and have declined since the dvd says that there is one thing worse than more people is affluence the dvd believes that more people are bad it is based on the belief that the earth can only support a certain number of people people have been producing alarmist documents for years warning of the impending limits on population growth the earth could very well support trillion people label tv throughout the room this product allows you to turn a tv to almost any direction in a room we have it mounted on the wall of our home office to allow viewing from the work area or from the relaxing area it is well made and works great if you are hesitant about installing then buy this and hire someone to install just ensure you mount to studs and follow directions label navy seal reader this book was really good it focuses on several missions instead of one the main characters are easy to like and root for plenty of action looks like it will be a good new series in the navy seals area label action reader this seal novel would be better if the writer had a good plot missions are good but lack realism team goes in and then out very little action and the spook is just not real suggest writer add more story and action for both sides seals are not perfect all the time even if they think they are these missions are to perfect label sounds don t work i find this product to be lovely i bought it some months ago for my baby and put it away until now that he is months and we can play with it but i just found out that the sounds of the bottom rings don t work i am so pissed off this is such a pity label must have for the serious notary i was impressed by the breath and depth of this book as well as by the practical examples i picked up the book used on amazon but would have gladly paid full price i keep it in my bag since it serves as a great reference label reprint of a classic this is a reprint of a very good book by john white likely to take advantage of the prayer of jabez craze while this book might not have the same popular appeal as jabez i believe it presents a more balanced perspective on prayer through the study of ten unique prayers in the bible even years later the observations and lessons from this book still remain true if you haven t thought much about prayer and god s interaction with us through prayer this is a great place to start label broke on first use used smallest pot in set boiled water got food out and left the water in pot while it cooled during super come back to clean and looked like someone tried to sit on it because the sides were cut at the top and it formed an oval it still had the water in it thus it was not someone sitting on it label good item they worked great for the home canning i did if i was in the restaurant business would need a heavy grade but for home is ok label shorter christian prayer the four week psalter of the liturgy of the hour i enjoy this book completely were i still have my pitfauts with the larger christian prayer book this little book helps to make things much easier for me to read and understand now i m still learning about how to use this tiny little book but it is fast becoming one of those books that i reach for each morning and evening at prayer time thanks it is a great little book to have at hand label nice size for a purse this is a nice book for morning and evening prayers it has a beautiful cover and is the right size to pit into a purse or bag to take on the go this is a perfect book to start praying the liturgy of the hours label this fiberglass foam board is a good economical upgrade from a wood board i ve been riding wooden boards for over years now i saw this board for sale and thought it was way too cheap for a full fiberglass foam board but i decided to take a risk and give it a try it s a major upgrade from my wooden boards with this i can waveskim or sandride it s very light weighing only lbs has a mild rocker and comes with a limited lifetime warranty it s not going to perform as well as namebrand boards like victoria exile zap etc but for the price i paid i m very happy label great service i received my purchase within days of ordering it and as described i will be using this vendor again label when faith is not enough if you are looking for a universalist s approach to dealing with doubt then this is the book for you clark s arguments completely miss the nature and cause of the majority of doubt that i have encountered pastor years to offer advice to christians over and above faith is not only foolish it is dangerous clark s arrogant approach may work in the ivory tower but for the rest of us dont waste your time or money label poor content bad presentation the movie itself is very run of the mill and humdrum the video quality is slightly woolly and there are no subtitles or captions on the disc so very poorly presented from a technical and accessibility standpoint label makes studying economics easy thumbs up this book is well organized to help student learn macroeconomics it has the best utilization of pedagogical features not just graphs captions and colors i ve ever seen i found key term call-outs section reviews and keypoint outlines to be the most helpful i appreciate the efforts of reducing the amount of reading necessary to understand the concepts if you are not a lazy student you will have lots of case studies news analysis econ puzzles and biographies to broaden your breath all these features are well organized so that you can read efficiently thanks to the ingenious layouts i am actually here to look for other books by mr taylor to support my current textbooks label great alternative for moms-to-be this is a great book for parents-to-be who already use and believe in homeopathy it is a little detailed for beginners this should be required reading for every ob and midwife the case histories are wonderful label a book only the author s mother could love the people who gave this book a five star rating must be related to the author or maybe its the author himself honestly as someone who has read almost every mafia book out there this book is just so so people should know that it focuses almost all of its attention on the new jersey court case and not on the street action its more about lawyers and the justice system than it is about criminals and the street label you have to fill it with water i didn t know that when i bought it so have not used it yet it makes it less convenient to use label don t buy thru deerso the item works just fine howevever the buying experience thru deerso was terrible i paid extra for expedited delivery but after they shipped it they said it would still be seven days from the time i ordered until the time i got it the customer service people totally didn t care i will never order anything thru deerso again label short life i have owned four of these one for the motorcycle one for the truck and one each for the cars the good these gauges are accurate repeatable and very small the bad they are disposable i get maybe a year out of them which is perhaps uses i tried to replace the battery in one it would be somewhat challenging for someone who did not have the necessary micro screw drivers and the patience to remove various items inside you will find a shoddy piece of electrical tape holding the battery in place nice touch after i installed a new battery reassembled the gauge and turned it on i discovered that it reset itself to units that are unfamiliar to me perhaps pascals i never did figure out how to change the units the price of the product is not worth the time i put into it anyway i don t recommend this digital pressure gauge label do not buy same as other reviews short battery life too expensive to be disposable weak bought for a bike trip and by the time the ride was over the battery was dead very disappointed and waste of label john has done it once again john s second effort is more than just g o o d its great when i first heard once again i wasn t sure i would like it mainly due to my expectations based on get lifted once again is not get lifted pt it stands firmly on its own two feet but you will get lifted pun intended john blends good old soul music with his own style to create wonderful songs such as each day gets better slow dance and where did my baby go to name a few you still get a get lifted feel with songs like stereo again and another again of course john takes you to his gospel roots with heaven and show me this album has something for everyone if you go in with an open mind you will come out with a musical experience you won t soon forget label cut from the same cloth as marvin gaye i anxiously awaited this cd after his first cd get lifted became a smash hit i actually anticipated somewhat of a sophomore fall off of sorts you must admit that st cd is a tough act to follow after listening to this cd for a couple of times i felt it was not quite up to the standard set by his st i mean the nd song heaven and the th slow dance are instant classics in my opinion but it wasn t until i heard the cd several times the th song show me and th p d a started to really stand out i believe as an artist he is as close as you get to the likes of marvin gaye i just happened to hear mercy mercy me by marvin after listening to legend i found the likeness striking i m not trying to say he is as great yet but he has the potential label disappointed based on a newsweek recommendation i m a first time legend buyer after listening once i tried to listen again and found myself at half priced books where my investment became cents at least the mcdonald s coffee was good the songs were smooth smooth as in flat without interest or color were the words introspective and deeply meaningful i don t know my attention kept wandering if jazzy soulful romantic ballads are for you grab this one its just not for me label copy-cat the song save room is almost exactly like the classics iv stormy listen to both and you ll see i thought john legend was supposed to be good turned me off really bad label excellent product best price i purchased this product for my inch phillips flat screen tv for my room i just move into in a townhouse and just purchased my tv and needed wall mount it came in like days i will say when i first received it and saw how small and light the box was i thought i got ripped off i made my brother who thought i should hire a professional to install it install it for me it took him about hours to do it but it turned out great its now december purchased in october i have no issues at all with it now my brother did go to best buy and purchased a wall mount for something dollar and he now regret that he spent that much money on a wall mount but men they just don t listen lol i can honestly say its a great purchased if your not picky and just need a wall mount that works and is sturdy then this is it if i had let the negative reviews get to me then i would have regret it love love label great value this is a good mount for the money i used a professional to install mine and he commented that the mount was very good it s comparable to others that are much more expensive label is hanging on it my is hanging on it and it works great easy to install and easy to mount the hdtv i have a vizio dont know if that matters much but it works great label good quanity at good price brought this for after much research and i m very happy with the result i put up my vizio led tv with no problem pros i like how hey give you different sizes of screws and universal washersmaterial very sturdy solid build installation much easier than i thought the hardest part was finding the stud in the wall con only complain i have its the design of the tv mount leaves little space behind the tv not a big problem just make sure to plug in your power cord and other cable before mounting the tv to the wall label great wall mount it was cheap and it works perfectly i mounted it twice since i moved months ago it tilts down so i can watch tv from my bed and can be adjusted for perfect position it does not tilt sideways and does not stick out i prefer that it does not stick out because i prefer to have it stick to the wall as much as possible the only thing that is bad about that is it can be hard inserting cables to the tv sometimes label for the price you can t go wrong i used this to wall-mount my led tv in my living room my parents couldn t believe i got a wall-mount for so cheap when they spent about times as much on theirs for the price you can t go wrong it s not the best mount but it ll do the trick on a budget i previously bought a more expensive mount from a store which is what holds my lcd tv in the bedroom and i will say that mount is better the tilt feature on that is better and unlatching it to take it off the wall if needed is easier than it is with this one tightening the screws at the bottom of this mount at the end of the installation process was kind of a pain label happy installed for a samsung tv saved a ton of money not buying one in a store so happy with this product im ordering a second one for our bedroom tv label good tv mount i mounted a lcd tv to my brick fireplace with this item no issues with the product itself although the instructions were absolutely pathetic shipping was very fast and package was in perfect condition the free cable is o k for standard definition but certainly not for use with hi-def i would buy this product again label great economical wall mount what a great deal on a wall mount why in the world anyone would pay double and triple the price of this wall mount is beyond me the installation was simple and easy just follow the instructions that are enclosed with the mount we mounted a zenith plasma tv and did not have any problems label tv wall hanger this bracket is sturdy i liked the way the tv just hangs up before you tighten all the screws in the lower bracket clips it takes a lot to lift the tv the six feet to the mount but if you can do that then you feel confident that it will not fall down it took three men to lift the tv above the fireplace it clipped right in and the rest was easy i liked the way the tv can slide on the bracket from side to side and tilt to where you like it best label very pleased i have a inch panasonic and the mount worked perfectly easy to install and they provide screws for all surfaces you would mount to you need to be able to find the studs in your wall and once the tv is mounted plugging in new plugs is hard it is best to plug things in before you put it on the wall mount works great though would recommend label perfect for my tv i recently purchased a plasma tv i found this wall mount on amazon it worked perfectly i can t understand why someone would pay hundreds of dollars for the same thing you can get online for a fraction of the cost the quality of the mount is great and the mounting is extremely easy don t waste your money paying someone to mount your flat screen tv do it yourself and save a ton of money i would highly recommend this product label holding a plasma well i bought this to mount our tv and it is working well the only improvement i d like to see is for screw holes closer to the middle so that you can bolt through sets of studs left center and right when mounting this to the wall i added the holes to secure to the center stud myself the level included with the kit wasn t but i don t count that as a big negative as i would expect to have a good quality level myself for a job like this label embarrassing daniels poetry is just prose and his prose is well just slop this book is just plain awful label unique approach to bargello i will not critique this book i do not yet know if the directions can be followed or the advice given is useful i have only just received my copy of this interesting book i will tell you one thing it is unique the designs the idea and the approach are original i also can t fault her color use i am writing a lot of these reviews as a buyer of these out-of-print books i always wish there was more information about them out there so here i am i am currently ok for almost a year now working on a needlepoint project that has a saying the cheese stands alone label colin hay and the genius of herbie hancock looking for jack is a good record and colin hay is such a talent the title track is the gem here in part because herbie hancock laid down perhaps the most brilliant piano track ever recorded on a pop song that few have ever heard it compliments the song the arrangement and colin s voice so well yet at the same time it s a song in itself it flourishes with such a melodic playfulness it makes the whole track irresistible label work great bought these for my subaru wrx jdm fog lights they work great they put out plenty of yellow light which is much better suited for foggy conditions label exellent epic escapist science fiction i can definitely count kage baker as one of my favorite authors as well as daniel keys moran and dan simmons i have enjoyed all of the company novels and this was no exception the storyline is quite complex and has some of the most well developed and intricate characters that i have ever read they also possess a quality that most characters in novels recently have lacked you actually care what happens to them and how they evolve so to the person who said baker may be losing his grip on the plot well first of all if you have truly read the books you would know that kage baker is a lady and second the story is only expanding and becoming truly intricate thank you and good night label kids lets put on a show love the movie and love the soundtrack although the soundtrack is exceptional it is not without it s share of problems the soundtrack is jam packed with glam classics from brian eno t rex roxy music pulp lou reed venus in furs etc granted that the album is full of priceless glam classics it is not the complete soundtrack i noticed that there are songs that are missing for example there are two brian eno songs featured in the movie that where not in the soundtrack amoungst others speaking of missing songs it wouldn t have botherd me a bit if they left out the songs coverd by ewam mcgregor and jonathan rhys meyers i can t believe they where allowed to tarnished an eno number and t v eye their vocals are pathetic but what redeems the album is the pulp song and the other glam classics not perfect but a great soundtrack label very uneven i got this cd becasue one i am a fan of glam rock it was a good price and i am a fan or radioehead how can you have soundtrack that is about the glam rock scene of the s and not include bowie all of the covers are not nearly as good as the originals the only good songs are virgina plain and satelite of love and camel in the eye but those are the original songs and i have those songs allready the songs of venus and furs dispointed me it seem thom was trying to sound like bryan ferry on them it would have been better if he just used his own voice if you want a good glam rock soundtrack may i suggest hedwig and the angry inch most of the songs are sung by one singer who has a better voice then most of the rock singers out today that soundtrack acutally does not sound like a soundtrack which i think is best i am not a big fan of various artist cds i ended up selling it for more then i paid for it label an accurate model of glam times i really wasn t crazy about the movie but the cd is really great shudder to think is the danny elfman of the late s highlight tracks tv eye a great cover of th century boy satelite of love and baby s on fire is soo cool i wonder if bowie likes this cd jules cohen lead singer of spiritease brand new album available multigenerational alter pop rock label amazing i had never hear of this movie or the soundtrack until i saw jonathan rhys meyers in gormenghast and had to watch all his movies i at first found the movie strange but it grows on you and the music is amazing my favorites have to be ballad of maxwell demon and the whole shebang even if you didn t like the movie you have to love the music especially if you love david bowie music like i do label must have gotten a bad batch i m only getting about of good copies from this set i ve used these before with only or bad disks in the set not this time though label product performed as expected i have gone through about disk recordings and none have failed the fact that i have not had a disk to fail saves me time and money label doesn t work well in dvd player i ve had this problem before but forgot and bought memorex again recorded movies seem to work well in a computer but on my dvd player they are unreadable probably about of them were bad you may suspect i have a bad dvd player but i haven t had any problems with other brands there is always the possibility my dvd player is getting weak but there s no denying that so far i ve only had problems with memorex label cuisinart ice frozen yogurt-ice cream sorbet makerbroke third time used i see that the model is no longer advertised my experience with it is used it times worked fine fourth time very noisy but that isn t my problem with it after the ice cream was made looked fine i and a strong man could not unlatch the top and we tried everything except a hammer i would love to know if anyone else had that problem label only worked for a short time i bought this new and it worked great until i made the mistake of taking the freezing bowl out of the freezer to thaw out and stored it for week when i refroze it a week later it never made ice cream again no matter how cold the freezer was or how long i kept it in there i suspect that once you freeze it and keep it in the freezer you must keep it in there from then on and never thaw it out i returned mine but i will never buy this type of ice cream maker again for fear that it won t work label yukon game gambrel i purchased a yukon game gamble about months ago prior to the kentucky upcoming deer season during my hunt i killed a large point buck with a bow and used the yukon game gamble to hang the animal from a rafter in a barn in order to field dress and process the animal this item was so easy to use and will allow one person to manage hanging an animal that weighed around lbs with little to no effort the instructions were very clear and the item works flawlessly this is definitely an item every hunter needs i will recommend this to all my hunting buddies and friends thanks yukon rick label whaling whaling has a long and exciting history there are chapters in this book on the dutch and english whalers the famous yankee whalers the norwegian and japanese whalers and a special chapter on the whales themselves label mis-represented the title of this item indicates it comes with k type thermocouple probes in the manufacturers description it infers the probes range is to f the truth is it comes with type k probe only usable to f the other mis-representation is that it comes with a protective holster the truth is it comes with an orange protective rubber over cover i would like to see these inaccuracies corrected on the amazon web site but cannot see a way to contact them label flows beautifullylike an open wound by the time i d gotten to slayer of gods i d gobbled up the previous five in order thereby attaining the level of anticipation of a hammerhead shark in a sea of egyptian blood i must say it was sheer pleasure to chomp through this one ms robinson is in the best narrative form of the whole series there are no serious breaks in the flow and action and the whole meal was over in wink leaving me still quite bloodthirsty for more don t peek at any plot details the previews reveal too much i have to say that i figured this one out almost immediately and i think you will too but it s wonderfully done from a dramatic and character perspective i give it only four stars because to me the plot has a many holes enough to make me uncomfortable and i m not the fussy type nevertheless a scrumptious and very suspenseful gobble label small but good at it is quite small but it s perfect if you re just making eggs for yourself or something like that quick clean up and heats up fast as well label there is only one word to describe this book tedious i made the mistake of buying several of the books in this series because the main character sounded interesting an overweight middle-aged pi i e not your run of the mill detective unfortunately the books turned out to be uniformly tedious the entire book consists of an endless succession of witness interviews interspersed with minute descriptions of every meal this full bodied woman eats and she eats constantly when the main character tries to act cute making what is intended to be humorous observations she only comes off as irritating i would definitely not recommend this series unless you suffer from insomnia label great book loved this book it is written so well that is makes you feel you are literally there at times experiencing exactly what caro s is describing so very much worth getting and reading and do not forget the other two books on lbj that caro wrote means of ascent and master of the senate the three are a trilogy with the path to power being the first one you should read well worth your time and money label outstanding highly readable and insightful a must read this is a cherished book in our household enjoyed equally by our history buffs and our novices it is fascinating reading and we cannot wait until the third volume is published label a historian s analysis succinctly the book is trash it is another product of the republican sleaze machine some good trees were ruined for nothing label beethoven dvd audio shipment prompt item as described this dvd audio will not become one of my favorites label a dissapointment compared to his last one what is this meth was so raw and hard-core on his first album and then this i was really disapointed when i heard this this was the one rapper i expeected to keep it real and what the hell is with the cyborg gear label slightly enlightening i was disappointed in the lack of content in this book while i was slightly enlightened with what appear to be some interesting facts i believe there could have been much more information resulting in a much thicker book i finished this in two quick sittings about a hour read this was a rush job without a lot of commitment to research the last few artists barely get a mention randy rhodes the guitarist that resurrected ozzy ozborne s career gets pages label miles distorted in mono again this is a very simple but straight forward review all tracks are in mono however that s not the main problem with this cd tracks teo and walkin are very distorted during mile s heavy solos this is truly a historic recording but don t waste your money i paid cents for it used and that was too much i don t want to waste anymore of your time reviewing this cd just don t buy it take it from an avid miles davis collector label simply awfull this is a terrible re-make of the original movie which was quite good what a waste of talent stay away from this mish-mash of a movie label oh the horror quite a tedious movie i must say for fans of horror this film fails to show anything truly scary chris kattan displayed some terrific acting though but the whole idea was it to be scary and it failed to do that for me label dvd would not play through i really liked this movie i ve been looking for it for a while i recieved the movie in the mail yesterday i watched of it before it started skipping i ve seen it a thousand times but i would have liked to have what i paid for label scarier than the exorcist i have been a horror film fan for years and i haven t came across a horror movie that has scaried me as bad as the exorcist this movie has out done the exorcist and it will send chills down your spin label why did i bother i kind of wanted to see this movie when it originally came out in theaters but i never got around to it i m glad i didn t this movie was really bad most of the scenes just didn t make any sense the characters weren t likeable at all i couldn t have cared less if they all got killed the acting was awful and the script was just down right horrendous some of the worst lines came from chris kattan s character like this house is alive we re all gonna die and you give me my money right now i want it so you give it thats the kind of bad script that i m talking about the only slightly decent thing in this movie is some of the special effects i would also like to give credit to geoffery rush for trying to do the best he could with what he was given all and all don t watch this movie label very disturbing this movie has some very disturbing images in it the plot started out well but then just turned sick the ending is like pulling a rabbit out of a hat it never would have happened anywhere else but hollywood a horrible movie label talk about a dive of a movie probably the worst movie i ever saw not only did the plot diminish as the movie progressed but the acting was ridiculous this was a poor attempt on the writers to make a scary movie out of a nothing plot and it wasn t even that scary more or less it was stupid and the idea was very unclear after watching it i couldn t tell you what it was about well actually it was about a house on haunted hill but who didn t know that already people visit it and i bet you can quess what happens from here they die amazing yeah right what ever happens to you don t and i mean don t see this disgrace of a movie label awful sure the original vincent price film was cheesy but it s a classic this film is neither cheesy or a classic it s just plain bad i don t understand what the draw to this type of horror is it s simply not scarry poorly made bad acting bad everything don t waste your time label definitely worth a look at jeffrey combs jeffrey combs is underused here like he is in seemingly every movie that he is in but director william malone utilizes a great score to keeps things moving at a crisp pace to hide the warts in the plot like why anyone in their right mind would go downstairs this is a vast improvement over the stinkeroo of an original not real scary but if they had used more of jeffrey combs as the mad doctor they really could have had something special bonus points for the dvd extras which are excellent why would anyone use vhs at this day and age go dvd and see this movie in all of its glory label not even woth renting is this movie what is the word sure it is bloody and gross but there is no story line and it is boring thru out what was the point they tried to make it interesting with all the bloody scenes and the killings but it turned out to be stupid and really unwatchable what was supposed to be a scary good movie turned out a bad silly movie label delightful this is a really easy to read book very matter of fact and as it s written by michael jackson himself it is a real joy it s a very nice looking book as well and i particularly like the way his signature is on one of the front pages so you feel as though he has actually signed it for the reader it s delightful it is interesting how the reader has the opportunity to hear michael jackson s version and intepretation of various events which is markedly different from the tabloid press and various writers if you have already read books about michael jackson you will recognise some of the events mentioned in the book the reader gets an insight into michael jackson s interpretation of the world rather than the tabloids interpretation of michael jackson s world label a must read for any mj fan this is michael in his own words i couldn t put it down if you are looking to get a sense of what michael was like and how he truly was then read this book i recommend this book to any mj fan and also the magic and the madness by j randy taborelli michael went through so much when he was alive it almost sadness me to read all that he had dealt with he was such a good person a caring person a true humantarian but most people forger that and want to focus only on the negative and what the media says michael was one of the greatest entertainers of music history and there will never be another like him label beautiful book by a beautiful man this book is incredible if you really want to know michael jackson this will tell you what you need to know label touching and humerous yet helpful for those seeking answers i have just finished reading this theraputic and helpful book for those who love time is eternal it relates to common everyday problems that happen within relationships and has witty thought-provoking and helpful meditations to soothe the soul it doesn t give answers but it helps you find answers within yourself it has daily meditations for jealousy simple interest body language and not having the ability to read minds i really enjoied this book and recommend it for everyone-krystal clairson label complete list this may be in the incorrect order but these are all the episodes have you seen this snail rock bottom3 the great snail race4 reef blower5 good neighbors6 krabs vs plankton7 lost matress8 skill crane label yay by hilfan90210 from l i n y i luv sb the episodes are have you seen this snail good neighbors whatz wit da phezez the great snail race how did tentacles turn into torlini skill crane y kant i win the lost mattress y prime cutz krabz vs plankton can some1 tell me wat happend what happend dat doctor guy shown in seasons he wasnt in funny pants now i think bout him itz driving me insane label great looking watch couldn t be more pleased with the look and performance of this watch the only drawback is that the date is a little difficult to set other than that excellent purchase label i love it love it love it best watch out there for a female it is elegant cute and goes with everything i got this watch as a valentines day gift years ago i absolutely love it no mechanical problems at all i hope seiko makes the same watch but with their new kinetic technology this is definitely worth the buy from amazon because local dealers charge the full price you wont be disappointed with this purchase the picture does not do it justice label so bad it s funny billonaire steven price geoffrey rush arranges a party at the abandoned vannacutt psychiatrist institute for the criminally insane in short house on haunted hill the institute was once the site of the most horrifying medical experiences in history price announces that anyone who manages to spend an entire night in the house will win he has secretly rigged the house with insidious devices designed to scare the guests out of staying but his tricks soon become meaningless as thr mansion begins to generate terror on its own before their night of terror is over the desperate inhabitants will unlock the secrets of the house or suffer the wrath of the demonic evil that haunts the walls of the former insane asylum house on haunted hill is a forgettable movie with laughable performances and a flippin terrible script it is equally terrible with the haunting s other so-bad-it s-funny try-hard horror label poorly written poorly edited although i did learn a lot about millard filmore from this book i think the presentation was flawed it contains many errors repetitions and examples of bad editing the author is one of those few people mostly from the south who insist that the civil war wasn t about slavery and he brings this up several times this detracts from his credibility though it was written quite recently it reads as if it was written in the late th or early th century label pure ear candy i too bought the tape when it first came out and wore it out i just paid a lot for the cd used and it was worth every bit of it how exciting to be listening to this album again love it label horrible this is the worst hair removing system ever it pinches your skin horribly and does not remove the hairs you have to continue going over and over the same hairs and for sensitive areas armpits bikini it is far too painful to even use save your money label epilady lengend purchase i purchased the epilady legend on amazon com for a christmas present i had already used this product and was very happy with it so i decided to purchase it for my daughter it is a great item the service i received from amazon was also great the item shipped in time for me to give it as a christmas gift thanks amazon rita label better than waxing any day i used to have an older style epilady and loved it but this new model is even better it has lots of little tweezers that rotate and pull your hairs out it takes a minute to get used to using it before your skin becomes desensitized but it s not that bad the results leave you with smooth skin no nubs and no more shaving for weeks label good product i have used epilady for about years this one was bought as a gift for my year old granddaughter i am hoping to spare her many years of distress label cordless epilady great product i was using the old coil type epilady that i had purchased years ago on my underarms it worked okay but it had a cord that developed a short after many years of use so i needed to replace it i purchased the cordless epilady and i love it i have used it at least a half dozen times and it still doesn t need to be recharged it does a good job and it is reasonably painless it is very compact label domenick s opinion boring slow predictable saving graces great italian scenery which you might as well concentrate on as the movie doesn t deseve that much attention even with his subtefuge i still don t see why they woiuld becomne freinds with matt damon s charchter considering he came across as a stupid twit mr damon is a good actor so it must have been the directors perception of the role overall a waste of time label it s ok my yr old loves thomas he has great hand eye coordination so i thought we would try this game even if his yr old sister had to help ok so the game graphics are definately rough and so are the voices both kids were very frustrated along with me on the lack of control in turning thomas down different tracks as you are driving thomas a small screen in the corner shows a map with blinking lights of where you need to go next along with an arrow but getting thomas to turn is not easy other than that it cute and a pretty easy concept for the game and well it s thomas so my son is happy label weak young inexperienced no-names are invited to get beat up on by the gracie s best i felt bad for these guys gracies are shameless label a good documentary on early years of mma a good look at the life inside and outside of the ring of an mixed-martial-art contestant rickson gracie his family helped popularize the concept of mma competition for north american audiences with the debut of the ultimate fighting champsionship back in in denver colorado even though rickson is probably the strongest gracie in terms of physical and technical abilities the family chose royce to compete in ufc to demonstrate that a physically small person can defeat much larger opponents using superior grappling techniques if you re a fan of mma this is a good dvd to watch to see how competition has evolved over the years label rickson gracie just one reason to buy this movie this movie is exactly what the american public needs to see they don t respect our sport its sometimes dubbed as being so brutal its nauseating the movie shows it not just dumb weight lifters who jump in a cage and beat the hell out of each other men who have trained most of their lives dedicated to their disipline need somewhere to show their skill they turn to the world of nhb combat this movie depicts the best fighters although i share the same feelings with others reviwers about todd hayes and koichiro kimura not being as great as they are showed to be talking about training their feelings about fighting their art even dying in the ring if your a fan of nhb combat or rickson gracie this video is a must see label onclear why is this book not updated drug companies are constantly changing prescription drugs so what is correct today might be wrong a year from now this book should be pulled off the shelves label puzzled about editor why is the editor of this book listed as andrew j buda in the search and brenda adderly in the link label great basic coffee maker this is a great coffee maker if you re looking for something easy to use and programmable also for the price it is a great deal label great coffeemaker for the price just purchased my third and fourth michael graves coffeemakers my husband and i go through a lot of coffeefrom making up his thermos in the morningto keeping the pots going up until the time we go to bed we wore out the first twothe heating plates do tend to give outbut that s my only criticism the coffee tastes great i love the styling and the no drip pour spout of the decanters in my opinion for the price it s the best value out there label overflows and makes a mess i bought this coffee maker specifically for the removable water reservoir however i d much prefer the mess made by a non-removable reservoir to having coffee and grounds all over the counter if the basket doesn t seat just and the carafe isn t pushed to the front right of the warming plate the pause-and-brew will engage and the whole thing overflows this seems to be happening about once a week despite our efforts to line everything up just so i would not walk but run from this model label i wanna love this machine i like the way it looks and love that i can remove and replace the water reservoir thing but it is very finicky to the point that i was just thinking about replacing it after only a couple weeks it s fine when it works but every thing about it has to be just so or the coffee won t drip the way it is designed it is unclear that there is a problem until it s not making coffee i ve been using drip machines for over years and never had this kind of issue before i think it s the machine label lasted months i purchased this coffee maker last july and it s now not working used daily worked well initially anyone else have issues with short product life label needlessly hard and difficult to use i consider this book a major disappointment much of the material is well-presented but too many words are used in the exercises and in the dialogues of each lesson that do not turn up in the glossary in the back i find the book really heavy going even with a dictionary some of the grammatical explanations are good but there are many idiomatic usages in the lessons and no real guidance of how to use them even after working through the book and tapes i don t feel at all confident in even simple conversation coverage of phonics is very skimply and the differences between different phonemes are not explained the recorded dialogues on the tapes are spoken very fast and are extremely difficult to follow i feel that the author could have used much more input from would-be users a book that purports to be a teach yourself book should be much more self-contained it should not be necessary so often for the user of it to have to consult outside references label a decent albeit real basic book as a beginners book it wasn t bad but i was expecting something new or more advanced that i ve read in better books previously advancedmacking com and how to be the jerk that women loveare much better books than this one label a morally chilling novel of suspense vachss shows he has literary guts in this burke novel where our anti-hero is hunting down a cult that preys onchildren and trains them for murder burke will have toconfront his deepest demons and question the morals ofhis vigilantism in this excellent novel label the cerebral detective this series ages well perhaps because of the s setting and it is a change of pace from the slam bang action of american detective shows it creates more mental stimulation than emotional without the soporific effect of many brit detective shows label poirot watch it daily and love it a bit more stimulating in regard to the investigations involved and intriguing in the manner portrayed label cheaply made i can see why this rack is so inexpensive it s very cheaply made with splinters of wood hanging off of it the parts are connected with staples too very shoddy workmanship i really only wanted the utensil drainer so i m happy with that my old rack is much better quality so i ll keep it and toss this piece of garbage it s not worth spending money to send it back label way too complicated i usually cook everything from scratch and don t mind spending a few hours making several appetizers but to make just one recipe in this book you d need to spend a couple of hours the majority of the recipes are too fussy and complicated and just not worth the trouble i made a couple of the crepe appetizers with different fillings they were the least time-consuming but the result still wasn t worth the effort no one took seconds label comprehensive look at formal hors d oeuvres this is an incredibly beautiful book not only will you enjoy looking at the fabulous pictures but you will also be inspired as you browse through it planning a party be forewarned however that almost all of the recipes in this book are geared towards very formal settings if you re looking for quick satisfying and tasty appetizers to whip out when friends stop by this is not the book to turn to nevertheless it is very thorough in discussing the various kinds of hors d oeuvres and the elements of each this makes it great for home cooks looking for a little education and if you ever give a formal party this would be the perfect book to use label replacement transducer this transducer performs well for fishfinding but was advertised as having a temperature sensor it doesn t work it would cost too much to uninstall and return so i just kept it my trolling motor does have a temp sensor when hooked to the same finder temperature is most important to me when bass fishing so i am not too worried disappointed but not worried label affordable and what i needed had a good price and i was able to determine exactly what i needed it was shipped on time and matched up like i had hoped label a lot less intimidating than he looks despite the goth-punk getup jean beauvoir sports in the cover photo fans of noisy hard-driving rock are not going to find it here instead beauvoir whose voice recalls that of mic murphy of techno-funk duo the system lays down a good solid set of sunny upbeat power-pop and a couple of well-crafted nicely polished pop ballads though not well known for his own recordings jb has had a long tenure in the music industry and he has worked with a prolific and diverse mix of artists including legendary hard rockers kiss and doo-wop vocal group the flamingos whom he sang with for a short time label powerful and refreshing angle on holiday favorites get it gather powerhouse musicians an orchestra choir and writer rob mathes and what do you get you get an incredible seasonal masterpiece of songs only available until now to select audiences rob mathes has made a name for himself in the new york area as a powerful singer song writer who really knows how to put on a show with his guest musicians vanessa williams michael mcdonald and david sanborn he has created a live cd that every household should have throughout the holidays keep it coming label simply the best stumbled upon the pbs airing of this christmas special in and fell in love what a musician this is our favorite christmas cd and we too have been known to listen to it all year just sit back relax and oh yeah don t forget to turn up the volume label how quick do you want it product was recieved very quick just one order click and it is on the way great way to do business wish everything in life could go so smoothly label sad story of one of show biz s most dysfunctional families if you want to know what could possibly lead michael jackson to think there is nothing inappropriate about sleeping with young boys in his bed read this book as much as i admire michael s top-notch performances and his discipline as an entertainer and businessman i am saddened by his poor judgement as a parent his inability to deal with his sexuality in appropriate ways his inordinate plastic surgery and his general fear of the adult world with the responsibilities it entails i can agree wholeheartedly that his childhood is worse than that of christina crawford s mommie dearest and that his father will have so much to account for on judgement day for the nightmare he put all of his children through but what s really sad is that this man has more than enough money to invest in some serious counseling and he won t get it tarborelli should publish an updated version of this book immediately label fun projects for you and the kids david stiles the book is extremely vague i thought the book would contain plans to construct forts playhouses etc this is not the case the book has drawings with a few overall dimensions but lacks specifics it does not contain plans materials lists etc this is not a how to book label sucked couldn t get it to work it had nothing to do with my pc runnning an alienware pc couldn t figure it out but didn t bother to figure it out it was a cheap game label lousy support this game does not load on the most common video cards i am a microsoft partner etc and can t even get the game to load and run properly over a dozen documented contacts to tech support never get replies to date it has been months and i have given up on the product and support label i cant play this game i bought this game and now i have no way to play it because my grapgics card isnt good enough and amazon makes it imposable to make a return because they hired an idiot to design thier site anyone who wet to a computer career school know that a contact number and email should be visamle and easy to find from the home page i cant find a number or email at all label poor chrome plating this product does what it is intended to do however the chrome plating on the tool was done poorly now the plating is flaking off in little tiny pieces that look like little metal shavings all over my garage floor overall this tool is low quality and a poor addition to my collection i would not recommend this product label if you haven t seen it you are missing out if there is one television show you can make time for this is the one you will not be disappointed you will want to thank me label its jerry springer in a hospitol in this show every doctor sleeps with one another every doctor has had surgery on themselves in the hospital gray and mc dreamy have done nothing but break up and get back together every man is a complete pussy doctors holler at there patients there is no punishment for murdering patients and everyone cheats on there spouses yeah this show is complete crap label grey s anatomy this is one of my must see shows i enjoyed viewing the season in its entirety they advertised unaired scenes and i don t think that there were quite that many so i was a little disappointed with that part label awesome loved watching the beginnings of one of the greatest shows on tv can t wait for the nd season to make it to dvd in sept label good stuff i am a physician so a lot of the medical matter makes me wince and i bear it yet there are those moments in every episode when i see the actors address real human emotions and frustrations that is when i almost forget that i am looking at more of the same sorta st elsewhere er let s play doctor trash this isn t trash it is entertainment the cast is almost believable label great viewing i only discovered grey s anatomy part way through the second season so this was essential viewing for me what a fantastic cast totally enjoyed it and have now ordered season label if it worked it might be nice i had cc bridge too far and loved it i bought this with hopes of more maps and more weapons my issue is i have a new intel4 pc and it runs everything else fine but cc in takes about seconds sometimes more before my click has a reaction ie selection conformation placement etc with such simple graphics and game-play it should be instant if anyone knows how to fix this i will update my review but at this point the game is unplayable label buyer beware if you have the most recent version of wordperfect beware this product will not install the wp8 language module on a windows platform apparently nt and will do but not they couldn t mention this in the advertising duh label real numbers i ve found these batteries to be well worth the money they are comparable to a good heavy duty non-alkaline set of batteries i have a program on my palm pilot called fpsutil3 that allows me to track the battery power curve over time they don t hold a top end charge for very long after only minutes but they really hold up well after that after hrs minutes minutes of nightlight after hrs after hrs after hrs minutes of nightlight after hrs battery warning after hrs minutesso after hours and minutes of power on over a day period with minutes of nightlight use they are ready for a hour charge not bad seeing as to how i m supposed to be able to charge them times i think i ll get my money out of them label these batteries saved me a lot of money i purchased pairs of these batteries for my palm pilot iiix because i was sick of spending a lot of money for non-rechargeable alkaline batteries and i found them very reliable there is no possibility of leakage with these batteries because they are nickel metal hydride and they provide a large amount of energy for my palm pilot using them i never found myself with empty batteries on the road they are much better than nicd batteries because they provide more then double mah and they do not loose their capacity with time i would not trust any other batteries to keep my data safe but energizer i use them in combination with energizer charger for nimh and nicd battery family label not as great as i expected them to be i am using these for my mp3 player i have a gb creative nano plus even after a complete charge the player does not show all bars for the battery strengh on the display i can see all bars with regular batteries they last for a little lesser time than these batteries i would recommend on trying the sony rechargeables they are the same price for aaa batteries label anyone know a date does anyone know an approximate date for release of the box set we have been waiting as well my whole family records the shows on dvr and its full i like to go back and rewatch them but i dont have any more room label cold case i just started watching this show earlier this year i can t believe i hadn t noticed it before there was a daylong marathon of cold case on tv and it held my interest all day and into the night this is one of the best shows i have ever seen the way they intertwine the past with the present is brilliant the plots are gripping and of course the music is the finishing touch this show should be on dvd it would be well worth the money as long as they keep the original format with the music great show with a great cast label no way to remember a giant the music is to be kind fair jimi is worth stars but i have to subtract one star for buddy miles playing boooooring where was mitch mitchel when you needed him i love hendrix i own all the records and repurchased the music on cd later i was inspired to play guitar because of jimi and later the allmans like most guitar players i have spent hours coping jimis songs despite my honest worship of jimi much of his live work was many cuts below his studio efforts he recorded live in an era with poor to non-exsistant monitering systems and played at stage volumes that made recording hit or in addition his affection for partying and showmanship took center stage and often overshawed his playing want a great live recording listen to red house recorded live in studio by the great edie krammer label hendrix live at the fillmore there are far too many interviews and not nearly enough film footage of the concert s who cares what lenny kravitz thinks he s making a living ripping off hendrix his opinion is worthless eddie kramer is the only one who s comments matter apart from buddy miles and billy cox there must be tons of concert footage they didn t use why they should have shown much more of the band playing and it would have been fabulous label good guitar not so good seller the bass guitar package we received was not anything like the picture or description we ended up having to buy another amp to go with the guitar as the one they sent was nothing like the one pictured and it was not compatible with the guitar the seller was very slow to respond to our complaint and they lacked any type of customer service in all fairness the guitar is agood beginner model for our grandson label very enjoyable i recently bought this book and i can tell you what a great way to spend a sunday afternoon i would have given the title stars if it had gone into greater depth on some of the subjects but hey it is of the world s greatest mysteries they ve got a lot of ground to cover here this is not an in depth exploration of life s deeper meanings this is a brief telling of great mysteries that skips like a rock on still water from subject to subject purely entertaining light reading and a truly enjoyable vacation for the mind enjoy label shirt mistake the shirt is advertised correctly as rd airborne brigade shirt but according to the pictures in the advertisement it says rd airborne division on the shirt and that is wrong label a lesson in improvisation i remember reading a review of some posthumous hendrix that stated latter hendrix is only for the staunchest i disagree and this disc proves it hendrix in his last year or so really started exploring the guitar he was not sitting still he was getting into jazz jamming with miles roland kirk etc ready for the next step i m old enough to remember how boring the jazz-rock scene was in the s but if hendrix had lived he might have taken it to new non-boring levels i love the improvisations on this disc dash of flamenco here some wes montgomery there wonderful stuff yes he was exhausted but hell i wish i could play like that when i m fully alert any student of guitar and music should view this show label a complete waste of time budget and poor acting first of all the producers know nothing about bogota and colombia in general they show bogota as a poor tropical crap as usual by many us producers directors and i m tired of this bogota is a beautiful million people city located at meters over the sea level so it s a cold weather city metropoli and not that tiny hotter than hell town shown in the movie very bad acting and stupid argument and dialogs don t get me wrong i was born in canada but i live in colombia and i liked the past movies of the series but this one is a big garbage and i will not waste my hard earned money on this you ll not see accurately what colombia really is and what happens here in this nice country so i recommend not to waste money on this nastiness label trash i sat through the entire movie hated it from the start and hated it even worse at the end the first movie i have just thrown away label nothin to lose nothin s for free can t stop now igot bitches money by buckcherry is a must have for any hardcore fan art the artwork on this ep is phenomenal there is a lovely collage of live shots of the band in the insert and it contains all the lyrics in both english and japanesea very well put together package music it contains porno star from the time bomb lp as well as a b-side and dramarama cover from that album anything anything i ll give you the second track can also be found on the road trip official sound track as for the three live tracks time bomb you and place in the sun they are from a broadcast of rockline in los angeles to the best of my knowledge the band sounds great on the tracks and those three tracks alone make it worth having as they are not available on any other buckcherry recording label absolutely untrustworthy as another reviewer wrote buy it used and buy it cheap well i did and still feel cheated after receiving it just this afternoon and spending minutes scanning through it i have to say that tab publishers producer of this rd edition obviously needs to clean house in their proofreading department and the author joseph j carr needs to pay more attention to the galley proofs when they re sent out missing diagrams wrong diagrams to match the diagram s text and just plain wrong information renders this book untrustworthy and therefore worthless amazon won t let me award zero stars so i am forced to give it one label bells whistles and aggrevation chessmaster has chosen not to upgrade or patch this was a fairly simple chess engine that does what a chess program engine should do set up the board set the level of play you desire and play chess set your timer if thats what you want try and play cafe style chess with i do not want to spend my time reading a manual or switching disks nor do i give a damn about josh putzke learning centers quizes rating evaluations personalities keep it simple stupid kiss label raghuraman not a good chess engine try fritz or shredder or junior they play much better game than this program shredder is the current world chess champion machine i am not sure whether chessmaster was ever tried for world championship programs like fritz deep fritz are used for enjoying the game and at the same time used by experts for anotating analyzing games fritz was extensively used to analyze games being played during fide world championship etc bugs crashes are not heard of those programs they run on all the windows os you get very decent programs on these sites label the big chill if i can t buy the cd with all the songs that were played in the movie then i won t buy it i know one cd could cover the entire movie so why can t this be done does it concern copy rights and releases label jerry bruckheimer scores another sixer the success key to all jerry bruckheimer films is the brilliant music score stuff the songs the score is what makes a film be it hans zimmer trevor rabin mark mancina or harry gregson williams the guy knows what ll go enemy of the state starts off with a perfect theme which gets you into the action mood then takes you deeper into the emotional mood not very artistic but it s commercial score at a very high level go jerry bruckheimer label not as good as i hoped this unit does not have the clean and clear sound that i hoped the adjustment of bass and treble could not achieve a good eq overall the volume limit is also relatively low i have owned the yamaha mcr series and this does not compare to those systems in terms of sound quality rounded sound volume or ability to drive nice headphones after six months i decided to buy another yamaha label great quality sound i bought the onkyo due to the great quality of sound i got in my recently purchased onkyo home theater and i couldn t be happier i am becoming a fan i have found out that onkyo receivers and amplifiers offer a variety of solutions that compete with most expensive devices onkyo is an affordable great quality of sound brand label actually this gets no stars just read what a viewer from usa wrote aug to the point this movie is offensive label little bear s band little bear dvd s are the next best thing to reading a story to a child sometimes you just don t have the time little bear is there to buy you some peace and quiet and entertain any preschooler with simple story lines label i just love it it is just so meaningful to me and i love the wonderful part of the past it reminds me of my great grandmothers kitchen on sat morning in s f calif in the s growing up pearl may penninger was her name and at the time i never knew how much that women would impact my life label too much postage for book old time farmhouse cooking rural american recipes and farm lore i was disappointed in the size of the book and definitely the cost of postage for such a small book label waste of money waste of space waste of time this game has got to be the single most poorly designed rpg on the market and i m not even taking into account the plethora of bugs that it has the interface cripples the game well enough if you ask me the ranger class is rendered totally useless or at least no more useful than a fighter with a bow since you can t move any characters in your party very far away from the rest of your party at all the story is very generic and extremely lame basically you re dumped in some ruins with very little explanation and you wander around killing things and wishing the interface wasn t so bad don t buy this game label don t even think of buying this now game is loaded with bugs after hours of play can t save without being dropped to the desktop installer works only on it s c program files etc installs only in the default dir no matter where you set it to unplayable at this point i m returning mine and wait for a stable release yes i would like to buy it again and play it once it s fixed want more go to www poolofradiance com tech forum and search for roster i can t even begin to describe the rest of the bugs you have to visit their site before buying that is the best advice i can give you all piece of unfinished i m running amd ghz asus a7mddr mb u160 scsi drives technical field as a profession this game is unfinished ubi soft starts to give me a scary feeling whenever i see it on any game box unfinished label sloooow and boooring i have really been looking forward to a new ssi d d game a good old fashioned dungeon crawl with awesome graphics sounded like a lot of fun it should be it really should be it isn t the problems the customization of characters is very limited you get to create four cookie cutter characters you might as well start with the pre-made characters for all the thought that goes into it the game action is terribly slow it takes forever to get anywhere by the time you get through a few rooms you are so bored you can t stand it i bought this game the day it came out and i have been trying to like it every since i have just given up that s i will never see again oh well lesson learned by the way the music is pretty good and the movement slow as it is is fluid and life-like i also have had no problems with crashes but then i have a fairly high end system i wouldn t buy this game unless you are a very patient person i reccomend instead baldur s gate ii label do not buy this game yet wait until next year first and formost this game is buggy and has even destroyed some os when trying to uninstall i got mine to run and played it for about hours during this time the game slowed to a halt about times a patch would resolve this problem but the game also suffers in gameplay all the hoot and holler about being the first e computer game for d d can be forgotten they butchered the rules but there is good news if you look past the bugs and the fact that this is not the game i was looking forward to a d d e game i think a great rpg might be in there somewhere but wait until they fix the darn thing update it has been about months since the games release and the big patch is not out yet wait until next year when if they get it fixed it will cost less then by then label slow gameplay and game crashes i am a huge fan of the original gold box games and was hoping this would be a revamp of those although the turn based combat is reminicent of those old beloved games that is where the simularities end the navigation system is terrible and slow the combat is slow and there is not enough random action label should not have been released i purchased this game and assumed it was finished it was not i set up my system with a minimal amount of space on c drive and this program must be installed on c even if you download the patch the installer still looks for enough space on c to install i wish i could give you a review of the actual play of the game but like i said i will not be able to play it until ubisoft puts out another install patch or i re-partition my system not likely either one unless you have lots of space on your c drive minimum mb don t get this you ll never be able to install label if i were you i d pass on this one i played the original pool of radiance on my commodore back in naturally i ve been looking forward to this updated sequel for months ordered it received it eagerly installed it all i can say is what a disappointment the storyline is generic and uninteresting the interface is cludgy and unintuitive and there are several things that are just plain annoying i don t know if i can bring myself to finish this game like the original version of pool of radiance you will waste a lot of time fighting long meaningless battles for little or no experience points all negative aspects aside the graphics and animations are great if you don t care about role-playing and an interesting storyline and just want to run around spending all of your time fighting for no reason then this game is for you label i want a refund after the anticipation i felt for this game all i can feel now is bewilderment how could this game have been released i have played for about four hours and have given up the gameplay is horrible it is slow the cursor movement is choppy and at first level my sorcerer has no spells i am unfamiliar with the rd edition rules of d d but i always thought a sorcerer would get at least one spell so it must be a game flaw i have not found one single quality in this game that would make it remotely fun to play do not waste your money on this game you will be better off playing baldur s gate bg2 or icewind dale again if you are a fan of these games as i am you will be sorely disappointed with pool of radiance label defending the game ok so many people ripped apart this game personally i didn t think it was that bad my game has only crashed once much less then bg2 when it first came out it s one of those games that gets really bad if you don t like it problems long combat slow game little choices example you can cast level spells but theres only one option for a class interface takes time to figure out what things do the manual is little helpknowledge of d d is importantnot much of an rpgpositives great graphicsruns smoothly no jerky movements cool dungen crawl systemfun combat turns allow you to enjoy spells turn based system allows you to enjoy combatmany mini quests in a dungenmany itemsoverall i enjoyed the game then again i got a great deal it is definatly not worth the money but if you find it for a cheap price i recommend getting it label garbage what a peace of garbage won t register nothing wrong with my internet connection won t down load hours of frustration took a couple hours off to cool off try again then the same old crap this is going back only reason it gets one star is because there s nothing less label great but dated disc set is nice but i am a big fan of disney films the animated classics will be forever imprinted in my mind i do have a huge problem with any censorship unfortunately the people at disney decided to buckle under to it because of a few cry babies complaining about racial stereotypes in some of their films i know i am not the first to say this but really are these people serious i am italian and german do you think i have not seen my share of stereotyping in my years on this planet why hasn t stromboli from pinochhio been altered for it s depiction of an italian it seems we are very selective with what we censor hhmmm i don t mind it because i know the characterization is just that and it doesn t reflect the entire race please stop censorship of any kind especially regarding these historic works of art you can not change history you can only learn from it label one box was not usable i purchased the product in february the product contained three boxes two of the three boxes were fine however one of the boxes did not have any liquid in it it had the color base but not the liquid therefore i couldn t use it the cap was tight it didn t spill it was never filled because it was completely dry label certainly not worth each we use v rechargable batteries at our church these will only last hours in a wireless microphone they will barely last hours in our wireless audio packs ear buds and when i use them for my electric bass wireless transmitter device they barely get through minutes of use per charge since we have three services and practice that morning as well these batteries do not cut it we found these digimate mah rechargeable v s that work much better we can get two complete weekends from one charge on these plus they were only each label like it alot i really do like the cd although it s not my favorite of theirs it does have alot of good songs on it i find myself listening to the other cd s more label great item this usb wireless adapter worked and still works like a charm installation is a brease and works on every computer and laptop i tried it pros great operation2 catches excellent signal over long distance due to the external antenna3 virtually plug and playcons the little prop-up antenna can break easy the plastic is not too strong2 if you switch usb ports it will ask for the driver again does not work with linux but i did not fight with it too much label not a very good receiver i have a netgear ma101 b usb adapter sitting next to the wg121 adapter the ma101 consistently receives a stronger signal by far compared to the wg121 both adapters are less than feet from the access point the wg121 cannot sustain a good connection i e a relative signal strength of on a scale of the ma101 indicates a perfect connection on a scale of always i will put up with the slower speed to get a stable consistent strong connection the wg121 is being returned and i will stick with the ma101 usb1 b adapter label constant lockups i ve had nothing but trouble with this adapter on my system my system locks up constantly if it is connected apparently a lot of other people with athlon systems are having the same problem so buyer beware label a must read the best this a a book for all of us that are looking to find god and not sure how to get their john eldredge is an author who shares his spiritual heart with your searching heart i have read of his books and he is a genuine spiritual follower of jesus christ he talks to me through his words in a way that i can relate this is a star book on a scale of best money you will spend label powerful application this book weaves the gospel message alongside all of the great stories and films over the last fifty years i found it to be inspirational and even gave a copy to each of my children with a reminder that their lives are part of a bigger story his-story because our personal history really is about god s story for each one of us it s a quick read but one you won t forget because of so many powerful life applications label it took a heroic effort to finish it yeah so i did want to see how it turned out but the ending was mostly so cliche it s not the increduality of the stripper hooking up with the nerd mortician but just everything else so predictable there was some potential but it didn t pan out about way through the film i was tracking how much time was left and using my utmost personal control to not fast forward to the end that movie plot technic very-loosely-interrelated collage of stories that make up a single film it s worn thin already eg forest whitaker never meets jessica biel in the film but they both related to the mortician at different timesbut did the mortician being the only mortician in the film get the boys body the tranny s body label had to return the dvd was mislabeled with the wrong zone it was listed as zone but when i received the dvd it was marked for a different zone that i couldn t play in the usa i had planned to purchase the same dvd again but the price had more than doubled and tripled needless to say i was very disappointed especially because of the misleading information given on my original purchase the movie itself is a very good story with excellent acting humor romance and fantasy all rolled into one the special effects are realistic i would recommend the movie for anyone who likes fantasy type stories such as harry potter or the lord of the rings it is that type of genre and very well done label i don t know why i love this movie so much it s hilarious that s why my friend kat first introduced me to this movie about a year ago and now i can t stop watching it it s got a great storyline and that stupid song will get stuck in your head for weeks d label i don t understand i honestly don t understand these reviews i bought this dvd because of a link to the th kingdom i tried to watch it several times but could not even get through it once it is terrible what were these other reviewers watching label gobletsa great game this is a beautiful game that involves lots of strategy we have one at home and i purchased this one as a gift for my nephews the price here was great so we are all happy gobblers label terrific game i bought gobblet for my year old who loves checkers and tic-tac-toe not only he loves gobblet his dad loves it even more what a great game for the whole family label rip off becareful when you order picture is deceiving item sent to me was plastic colorful colors and for a very young childs eye not for a yr old then when i sent it back only credited alittle over i payed alot more i was not sent the item in the picture major disappointment label this is a great family game highly recommended it s a fun game and it definitely challenges people of all ages we love it and have bought it for many of our extended family members as gifts label fun for the whole family this game really gets you thinking about strategy i think it is probably a great way to prepare kids for a game like chess my husband and i also enjoy playing this game it is well packaged not in a cardboard box like most games the directions are pretty good although we were confused at first about what kind of movements were allowed but we seemed to get it all figured out a very calm fairly fast game would be a great game for much older folks too label poppin the hood i originally heard a cut from this album and thought it would be a great comedy album for my collection unfortunately that was the only funny track on this album it did not measure up to my expectations very few tracks are funny and once listened to it is better off filed in the trash label good stuff i practice kung fu tai chi and chi gung i m not a reiki practitioner but the music is soothing for my meditation and tai chi forms this particular cd is very good every song is almost exactly minutes long the song changes signal when you should switch to the next reiki position if you are using it but for me it is good for slow chi gung excercises still it s relaxing music for any situation the car the office etc i listen to it everywhere and suggest you listen to it too label not a textbook this book is not a regular textbook or even a non-traditional textbook it really is just what it claims to be and nothing more tips on how to improve your japanese it is fun and helpful but it s not a book for total beginners you need to know some japanese before it can really work for you i really likemaking sense of japanese what the textbooks don t tell you a nice companion to this book i own both of these and i think i got more out of making sense actually both books are about learning japanese they re not directly teaching you to speak the language just keep that in mind when making your purchase decision label a super guide to people of all ages as an anime lover and general japanese enthusiast i think this book is very intelligent and fun to work with there are only two problems a the price b they dont teach you how to read kanji label music is cooking sound quality is stone cold this is a great live album my only complaint is the sound quality i have played this disc on a decent system dedicated cd transport tube amps and beyond-modest speakers and find that instrument separation and sound stage are virtually non-existent i have played tons of other miles albums on the same system and most of them sound great especially the columbia sony releases remastered or not i strongly recommend the highlights from plugged nickel instead unless you don t mind hearing the great est jazz live performance using one ear label amazing and so much fun so much fun i got this for christmas and lately its been hey do you want to play hockey it is big and fun and it comes with two goalie sticks one for each goal and four sticks one for each person it is so much fun label goldfinger dvd well this dvd is jsut awesome and i dont know what that dude is saying that blink fans cant appreaciate this kind of music cuz im a blink fan too and i love goldfinger s music its like totally awesome this dvd is the best its got tons of like extras and old live shows totally amazing if you are a goldfinger fan you should definatly get it label maybe chinese drywall is easier to cut i ve cut narrow strips no problem no problem except i have to measure with a tape everytime i change size because the built in rule cuts narrow i have found anything bigger than inch doesn t cut all the way through i m cutting inch and have the wheels set all the way in the u shaped piece of metal bends and i have to use a razor it makes a nice straight line to cut along though i guess i should have paid times as much for the american stripper label wonderful performances i ve been a fan of ms carlson since the mid s when she performed locally in rock bands her move to jazz standards was the right move not to knock her ability to rock this is a wonderful album with strong performances by her and her accompanying musicians i think it s stronger than her critically acclaimed christmas albumthis christmas my favorite things i ve listened to this album literally hundreds of times and it still wears very well label help me please i m frequently up in the middle of the night with one of our two babies and i just became completely hooked on this show i dvr all the episodes in case we all happen to be sleeping and i can t wait to see each new episode the problem however is that it s not listed on the dhlth channel at all after tomorrow mandy patinkin s character just had his license reinstated after a brief suspension and hearing he and diane venora s character just broke up what happens next someone help me please chicago hope-ful label release them all and i shall buy mandy patinkins is a very underrated actor i would love to see him in this show to see a master like e g marshall in quality television towards the end of his working career would also be truly amazing hector elizondo is always underrated and i always thought that adam arkin was george clooney they look the same i thought clooney was on chicago hope and that was what made him famous i do think er is probably one of the finest tv shows ever so would be curious to see how hope pans out if it ever comes out i haven t seen st elsewhere yet and am hesitant to buy the first season the only reason being that if i like it i would be annoyed if they don t release the following seasons label oh where are the lights delonghi dch1030 ceramic heaterdon t buy this space heater unless you don t mind partial outages throughout your house it s just too strong and it tripped over and over parts of our home eehhhhh even the tvs and the pc finally had to call an electricn and we all know how expensive they can be but he asked if we had ahy new electirical things in the house we didn t even think of the space heater the electican just happened to see the space heater on the floor by my pc cool area here and immediately picked it up sure enough it was a w it was the culprit i have run other w space heaters but there is just something about this little lemon cost us for the electrican cheap around here you are warned label don t be fooled don t be fooled this book has a title very similar to the ultimate book of kid concocitons book i saw on pbs i bought this book thinking it was the pbs book and was very upset i m sure i am not the only one making this mistake the projects in this book are out dated and seem to be the same old things that have been around for years buyer beware i would bet the publisher did this to trick people into buying there book label virtual makeover i got this product with no information and i can see it on my computer but it wont let me add any photos i was getting it for fun but it has only been frusterating label when god doesn t heal when god doesn t heal let s ask jesus the one who bore all of our sicknesses and pains about that one it s not god who doesn t heal us it s us who don t receive the healing that he already provided through the cross of christ and by his grace what a completely disrespectful thing to say about god when god doesn t heal another lie of religion label very unhappy i expected to recieve a book not a small pamphlet for i had the great grace to have msgr turro as an instructor in seminary and seek anything he has written but not pages for when contacting the seller and amazon to return it i have not had any response this is the first time i have ever had any problems returning anything with amazon i caution anyone using this seller label an unknown gift i m not really into this kind of music but this harp music is very elusive and well crafted the pieces sing to you and take you on a journey label as always amazing music i love this album several of the songs were remixes or new approaches to ones i already know and love while the rest were completely new to me however as a big fan of des ree the new songs do not disappoint a great album even though it only plays on a few of my cd players label art is eternal the combination of miles davis and gil evans is unequaled the music they and gifted sidemen created is timeless and brilliant and it swings rocks grooves and kills even after over years label awesome grip this is such an awesome grip it made my years old ruger p89 looks brand new not only it looks great but it fits great it also feels better shooting my p89 for sure i highly recommend this grip on your ruger p series label great on my ruger p89 the only reason i m not giving this stars is because it arrived over a week late aside from that i love it it s easy to install just remove the two screws and pop it on it fits great and looks good too most importantly it fits perfectly in my hand i absolutely love it label great product for everyone so i bought this funny looking saddle because i had cyst on my lady parts and could no longer use a regular bike seat no fun this bike seat took all the pressure off said sensitive bits and is actually more comfortable in general than normal bike seats medical problems or not i have ridden it for about months now and taken the bike out on a hour trip as well as short term city biking over all it is of excellent quality yes there are some problems with this seat you loose the ability to steer with your legs and on long bike rides your thighs will be a bit sore but you will be less sore than you would have been on a regular seat and your sensitive areas will be just fine over all i highly recommend this seat for all label it was not what i expected the book message in a bottle written by jenny k was as many people wrote in their reviews an insult to human intelligence but the one written by nicholas sparks happens to have a different touch to it making readers all over the world savor the story i have read message in a bottle by sparks about times because i loved it the first time and had me craving for it more times but lets be nice and at least give jenny k the credit for writing it label nothing new here seems like the message of this documentary could be delivered in minutes every thing needs to be made into an hours just get to the point label ingredients knocked my socks off this is absoluty a must see if you wonder about why they re putting aresnic on meat at grocery stores why we have flourine absolutly toxic mass-scale industrial waste from the fertilizer industry in our water supply or why genetically modified seeds are grown into obscenely larger plants and then sprayed with toxic weed killer on a weekly basis for months upon months round up in your food that you eat think about it label essentials of sociology great book the book is written very well and is filled with tons of information the numerous real world stories within each chapter help readers see the concepts in sociology the textbook introduces applied to the real world and the stories are incredibly interesting recommended for anyone who is interested in studying sociology label i really struggled with the heroine i finished this book yesterday and even after a day i m still irritated by the h s attitude again considering the time period i found the h s attitude very st century we are told constantly how different her family is and how her mother just wants her to have a love match i sincerely doubt that any parent of the day would have gone to such trouble to get their daughter alone with a young handsome and eligible male inevitably the h sleeps with the h but refuses to marry him of course the thought of pregnancy never enters her mind although later it does the fact that she continually doubted the h s love for her and he professed it quickly and if i were him i would have found someone more deserving i bought the trilogy which i ve put aside for now because i was so put off by violet i do like the author though and enjoyed the temptation trilogy so i ll probably pick up the second book at a later date label lamplight farmers lantern this lamp really was not what i thought it was suppose to be it has to use oil i wanted battery label typical of the series one of the problems with enterprise is the accusation it ignores establised canon the premise of this story if vulcans kill does it betray the teachings of surak has already been addressed in the original series by spock label great gift i loved everything about this ring unique design comfortable nice weight i received it on x-mas eve and wasn t expecting to receive it in time for the holiday bonus the only reason i gave it stars instead of is due to the sizing it runs a little large my overall experience with this company was excellent label cracks under pressure it s unfortunate that a pda with so much promise is built so poorly the case chips easily and the surface you write on cracks very easily i ve already had to replace one to the tune of if you plan on using your pda as a truly portable computer on that will be with you on the road i d highly recommend you look at other options like the palm pilot compaq ipaq or the hewlett packard vornada all sturdier offerings the handspring cracks under even the slightest pressure label absolutely brilliant i have been a fan of no doubt for about years now and this is just a little something to show how much they have achieved the singles album is something everyone should own track to track it is pure genius from upbeat rocky classics that instantly put you in a good mood to slower beats such as running that just make you smile and relax you then the everything in time album is just as good it contains rare songs and remixes and they all hold a unique catchiness however the dvd s really top off this package the videos dvd is pure genius the videos are amazing to watch and the live in the tragic kingdom just gives you an example of how cool they are live if you are a no doubt fan you must own this enjoy label worth the price of admission just for cleese s eulogy to graham chapman i loved this set things i d never seen dirt about the filming of holy grail brian meaning of life cleese in a dirndl was quite fetching his eulogy of graham chapman was almost worth the price of admission too bad there were no llamas no small marsupials ate the delicious eucalyptus leaves yum yum g day bruce label happy rats there are far less things in this product my rats wont eat it s hard to find rat food that isnt all seed which they wont touch they like most of what is in this label a book that won t dissapoint you awesome book i learned more about the holy spirit and how he affects my life daily than i have learned in the years of walking as a christian i was in two bible study settings for the study of this book and each one saw something new and exciting about the holy spirit and his presence in our lives today i highly recommend this book label umax astra vs microsoft xp home purchased in june tested briefly with microsoft me upgraded to xp home in january but during installation discovered products are not compatible i get no help or encouragement from either umax or miscrosoft label end of the story i absolutely love this book i originally found this book at a library borrowed it renewed it at least times and i bought it so i can keep it forever amazing book it s like playboy magazine or food network magazine for me makes my eyes delighted label beautiful pictures but not a book to learn about goldfish a nice gift book for someone who has goldfish though label the lion terrified my son my son is a huge fan of hide and seek elmer i bought elmer s friends thinking he would love this as well there is a lion in this book that has the most frightening face my son would start to cry the page before in anticipation of the upcoming lion i tore that page out of the book and now my child can enjoy this book again the other animals are fun but the lion is terrifying label good information poor quality just received this book after waiting months for it i purchased it because it is often referenced in other cm books after just scanning through the book i can tell that it contains some valuable information one big minus is the index consists of blank pages which is really bad for a technical book the physical quality of the book is very poor cheap binding cheap paper cheap type except for the nice cover it looks like it was thrown together at kinkos what really irks me is that i paid almost for this book this is something i would pay for a pdf download label would i measure up this movie had haunted me ever since i first saw it on los angeles tv when i was twelve years old being the son of a career soldier it was always expected that some day i would serve in the army i always wondered whether i would measure up and be able to lead men in combat in i found myself leading a team of american soldiers advising an army in a very deadly war against a communist insurgency leadership in combat is the ultimate challenge and when my tour ended i felt no different then how richard basehart s character did at the end of this movie though a bit dated this movie is my all time favorite and definitely a keeper label a dissappointment frankly i m quite dissapointed in this film it s in black and white which actually is no problem for me since i enjoy classic war films the dissappointmnet is that the whole movie seems to be shot in a studio and a very small studio really dissapointed also nothing really special about the story label korean war movie in my opinion this was a terrible movie it deals with a corporal richard basehart who has leadership issues i e will he be able to lead if he is put in that situation a better movie would be hell is for heroes which also deals with the korean war or retreat hell starring frank lovejoy don t waste your money or time on this one label i think this is a very good cd the only thing wrong with this cd is that they have to many skits they need to cut down on them label wooooo this album is so kool-aid pumping sweeeeet it gave me a cavity redmans heart pumps kool-aid on this joint its tired burn it give me mc eiht label oh man what a waste of a good godzilla title godzilla s revenge what comes to mind when you think of that i thought godzilla becomes evil and devastates tokyo while fighting monsters that idea is much better than the one in this movie this is all in a boy s dream what the heck now i enjoy godzilla movies i even liked son of godzilla but this movie is a disgrace why would minilla be barney and talk what s with this bully nonsense i wanted rubber monsters action the only good point of this movie is godzilla verses gabara that s the only thing that gave this an extra star because everything else is stock footage label oh the pain have mercy oh my gosh i have now seen how bad a movie can get i mean where s the revenge here people what was toho thinking minilla talks this movie does not have any monsters in it besides the ones in the boy s head if you want to see a movie with cool monsters you will regret it now if you re looking for the closest thing to tellatubbies besides barney this is definetly what you re looking for this is not a godzilla movie in the slightest label godzilla as barney well almost this movie is definitly geared towards younger audiences most of the fight scenes are stock footage from other films the plot is kiddy and the dubbing is worse then usual there are two reasons to get this movie one if you are a godzilla fan and want to introduce your children to the series this is a good way to do it this is a great way to spend some quality time with your child and maybe pass on some of what you like about the godzilla series the other reason if your a collector or completionist buy the video watch it once and bury it on a deep shelf every self proclaimed godzilla fan should have to watch this video once it reminds us that godzilla is for all ages and it shows that maybe the american godzilla wasn t that bad after all it could have been based on this label a stunning scifi action novel rarely does a book come my way that i actually cant wait to see the outcome of crossworld is one of those rare and compelling stories that anybody with an open mind will enjoy the story itself is top notch with hints of the matrix and blade scattered throughout robert aldrich continually keeps things at a fast and enjoyable pace without sacrificing genious storytelling and immersive detail just wait until you witness the awesome hardcore action sequences which are beautifully crafted in every chapter i fully recommend this adventure tale to anyone with a love of science fiction anime fantasy and breathtaking action i am eagerly awaiting the following volumes label keep out a picker but not a kicker we still use these around the house at all entrance doors they grasp under the door knob and plant a rubber footer on the floor if the floor is smooth like tile or vinyl the footer and the floor need to be kept clean otherwise it can slip when forced i tried getting in once while the thing was in place and i could not do it until i really forced it for a while i m a big guy but i think anyone could get past it if they were determined therefore we use it as a way to keep lock pickers out and we don t expect it to prevent someone from kicking in the door there are other devices for that purpose for people who live in those areas where burglaries are committed by serious career criminals the only thing we get around here might be the wayward teen who might take something if it s easy so i cannot give it stars it will not keep out someone who is determined to get in otherwise it is sturdy and easy to use label false sense of security i bought this item because i am a stay at home mom with a hand disability we live in a rental apartment and i am very scared to have people break into my home while my husband is off truck driving first off it is very sturdy looking but my year old son was able to dislodge it from the door with little effort my husband was also able to break into the door after losing his key to the garage by simple pushing the door back and forth twice to dislodge the device it is good if you are paraoid but know that it doesn t really help prevent a break in but it will buy a few seconds and alarm me to an intruder label great security for the price definitely a good buy i use it for my front door and it doesn t slip or budge an inch when someone tries to open the door i feel much more secure since i live alone in an apartment i ve recommended it to friends and family who are pleased with their purchase as well label nothing to compare to other pinball game this game is well just another video game nothing like a real pinball game and im sorry but some people that wrote review on this game should try some real paintball simulator like platinum pinball i would pay about a dollard for this game maybe less label this is a lb hammer not lb as the title states title says it all somebody doing data entry messed this one up it s a lb dead-blow hammer not a lb as the title and description claims you can google the model number or zoom in on the picture to verify the label on the handle says lb returned for a prompt refund label pretty cool but not the whole way this movie rocks my aunt bought me this and i ve loved it she knows i like sonic i gave it a outta cuase of sonic s voice acting at the beginning he sounds relaxed and all cool but in the middle of the movie he sounds like an englishman what s up with that and also it s too dang short i just want to see more after it s over one pro is that catchy look alike tune at the end they should release that song as a single sooner or later anyway it s a great movie and any sonic fan should get it p s who s cooler than tails label this movie sucked i have seen many sonic cartoons over the years and this movie was the worst the animation was crappy and the character voices cracked over all it was a bad movie i wouldnt recamend it at all label very disappointed with the prism i purchased a visor prism as a christmas gift when it arrived i installed the hardware and software exactly as instructed in the manual the visor would perform a hot sync but would not install any applications after nearly a dozen phone calls to handspring s technical support they were still unable to correct the problem despite the fact that this case was escalated three times by handspring s technical support department this entire fiasco has taken close to a month i don t anticipate buying any additional products from handspring i suggest going with a palm it s more reliable label handspring prism the product worked but the batteries are no good in only a day the batteries drain and the memory is lost other than that i received everything i was promised label to bulky i am going to keep my review short and to the point like the palm iic this portable won t fit in you pocket its to bulky you would be better buying a sony clie or palm before investing your money in the prism label wheeler is no netter this book is wordy and lacks organization it is full of awkward sentences rambling paragraphs and has no sense of continuity the diagrams are not labeled of low quality and seemingly outdated there are much better anatomy references out there and i suggest looking into the other literature wheeler s text simply demonstrates the need for a frank netter of sorts someone who can do for oral anatomy what dr netter did for gross anatomy i m actually considering writing my own text one day so that future students will be able to spend more time focusing on anatomy rather than the minutia and distractions that this book is full of if you need to learn oral anatomy this is not the book that will help label hoyle board games has turned the family into addicts hoyle board games is a fabulous collection of thoroughly enjoyable and addicting family board games these great games include beautiful graphic versions of backgammon mancala chinese checkers chess dominoes pachisi mah jong tiles and the addicting mah jong gravity also there are great versions of battle ships master mind connect four yahtzee and chutes and laddersall disquised by easily identified title variations a fun game called placer racer is a family favorite it isn t really a board game more of an arcade gameshooting colored balls trying to make matches of three while you race against a steadily decreasing game area this collection of board games is great and i wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants fun wholesome clean fun for the family label all in one i couldn t believe that there was a box set of this series it is a must have for thoes who have dabbled in the method workouts each of these workouts flow with one another and having the box set means less money and you can follow through with the total workout i love this series because they are a are fun to do combining dance yoga weights and pilates to give you a challenging full body workout that doesn t stress out your body these tapes are set up so that if you don t have a lot of time to workout you can just do one section and you will still sweat you can also mix and match certian routines to keep your workout interesting i would recomend these tapes for anyone who is tired of repitition workouts and who are ready to have fun and be creative while sweating away label life source ub advanced memory wrist auro totaly inadequate i take the blood pressure following directions and i get different readings i have been a nurse for over years and i can t use label so far so good nice product received item quickly well packaged popped batteries in and went to town works very well adaptable to various size wrists label beautiful bed this bed is good quality the matress pad blanket and pillow are cute and perfect for this bed my girls use it and love it the doll is so real and sweet its great to have a nice place to put her its easy to put together and can be taken a part easily for storage i think this is the second thing to get after buying annabell label macross the movie this movie blows i wasted my money on this one i watched it and the whole plot just sucks why would i watch a movie where the main weapon is a song do not waste your time with this one label it has on off switch on off switch was the reason why i picked this light out of similar lights don t have it and without ityou have to unplug it from usb just to turn it off works great for my needs fair quality buy it label what you want is the fourth edition i m sure this book was great in the s but this is the st century when you can buy the fourth edition there has been a ton of advancement between and label good illustrations bad writing i don t understand any of these other reviewers the book has lots of colorful illustrations and the thickness make the book look comprehensive but the writing seems to need more organization surely it could have been written more concisely incredibly boring to read through label disapointing your editorial review is correct but understates the technical problem with the sound in this whole series the excess reverberation poor audio production and the english accents make this almost indecipherable by north americans i get the feeling that the director is very visually oriented but he tries to get cute and technical the trick shots are just too contrived the cast does not seem to be having any fun the hallmark of a good g s performance they are not sharing the joke because they are so pre occupied with their technique i far prefer the series done at stratford in canada rather than this candidate for madame tusaud s museum label tasty recipes with few ingredients i ve used this cookbook several times and every dish i ve made has come out great the thing i like best is that most of the recipes have relatively few ingredients and simple steps i have several crockpot cookbooks and i ve found this one to be the best label rather disapointing this collection would be fun if all the games could be played head to head online but they can t the pool game is fun but you are much better off buying sierra s maximum pool instead label bad analog recording background noise for digital music i purchased this product mainly for recording my lp collection into digitial format using my laptop i thought that this could be a good product for that purpose until i used it this product could not record properly from analog input it s even much much worse than recording using laptop s analog input not only the recording level was so low but also the recorded mp3 or wma had so much artificial noise that it was unusable i used usb2 connection all the time it seems to me that usb2 doesn t help any better playing digital music was relatively ok except that it produced slight background white noise still directly connecting from my laptop to the speaker produced much better result i wonder what the purpose of this device might be not recommended label berlitz employees write these reviews berlitz employees write most of the gushing reviews posted on this site beware that there are much less expensive products that there is nothing revolutionary about these products and that you will find less expensive variants elsewhere be cost conscious and know that you will not learn a language from a cd rom label dale bruning smooooth i once read in the liner notes of an ed bickert album about how refreshing it is to hear jazz that is quiet and pretty such is the case here no pyrotechnic chops or blistering arpeggios just simple good tasty jazz lines moore and bruning blend together perfectly as they have done before if you re into the likes of jim hall ed bickert or royce campbell you can t go wrong with this cd label beware it is a single i purchased this cd for not realizing that it was a single it may have been labeled but at that price who would think it was a single it is now selling for about of that price which is much more reasonable unfortunately i didn t realize this until after i opened it it was very disappointing to say the least label post-war germany and it s past haunting it rating frank defelitta wrote a good story on a holocaust survivor mental patient on a killing spree to advenge the wrongs of the past it has a good storyline and takes you into s germany and israel and you get a feeling of the time the relationship between the detective and female holocaust survivor leaves the reader confused and disappointed i still pull my copy out read it every few years label love the balance buddy best money ever spent we tried for a day or two the old fashioned way with me holding the back of the seat and had the worst time when we used the balance buddy my daughter learned in days no bending over for me and she was so much more stable label strike out mr woodcock had such great potential but failed to deliver there are some real heavy hitters in the cast billy bob thornton has the capacity to make any film a classic when directed properly although he had his moments in this one susan sarandon was probably not right for the part or was right for the part if the film was executed correctly she is a gifted and elegant actress who can make a role striking and memorable this role was beneath her to say the least seann william scott is a modern comedy genuis he has the look the resume and the chops to take a movie to the next level he was also probably not right for this role he belongs in hollywood blockbusters not forgettable films like mr woodcock three terrific actors combined into one film should have been a winner but just couldn t do it three strikes label abysmal sean william scott billy bob thornton and susan sarandon are capable if not excellent actors in fact i m certain that if anyone with lesser hollywood standing had been in this it would never have been made other than a couple of funny lines delivered by supporting actor ethan supplee there was nothing to laugh at it s bad santa thornton watered down to the least while everyone else on screen is wooden and bland in a movie so predictable that i have a hard time believing it was even written here s the deal small town boy makes good goes home for accolades meets mothers new boyfriend hates mothers new boyfriend decides he s being selfish and works to get them back together i don t recommend buying it i don t recommend renting it if you re bedridden when it comes on tbs at am and the batteries in your remote are dead that should be your only excuse for watching it label mr woodcock is no bad santa mr woodcock was quite a disappointment considering the presence of seann william scott billy bob thornton and susan sarandon among others a best-selling author returns home to pick up a prestigious local award only to find his mom dating his high school gym teacher that used to terrorize him and shatter his self esteem things quickly become more complicated when the hazing starts anew as the gym teacher picks up where he left off in short the acting is pretty good though nothing great while the plot and the dialogues are average and below average though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off primarily due to the writers and the poor choice of lines and weak plot in a nutshell it s a mediocre movie and that s about it no masterpiece here stars label what kind of humour do you like if you are the type to laugh if another person gets a ball in their privates you may like this movie after scott s th humiliation i couldn t bare seeing more i was expecting some equal kind of comic battle between the two characters like scott getting equal with thornton doesn t happen instead scott is humiliated throughout the movie also that the unsympathetic character played by thornton always comes out as the smug one is very disturbing label do not buy this tv do not buy this tv i bought this model six months ago and it has been in the repair shop for four out of the six months the light engine has burned out twice and the customer service support at rca is atrocious any time you call customer service you literally have to wait over an hour to talk to someone who can t tell you anything about the status of your repair or when parts might arrive at your local repair shop in fact after dealing with rca s customer service center i would recommend never to buy rca period they refuse to do any exchanges through any of their dealers and they have promised twice to exchange direct from the warehouse only to go back on their promise to say they ve found the part i need only to ship the wrong part to the local repair center and then make excuses and say another one is on the way this has happened to me twice now and my tv is still being repaired with no end in sight do not let this happen to you label the beatles long winding road as a hard-core inveterate beatles fan i loved this collection it is true that the narrator has the enthusiasm of a dead horse but don t let that stop you from enjoying this collection viewers will be treated to some bonus footage of the beatles in newsclips and interviews no songs are included in this collection it is power-packed with information and if you can overlook the tiring drone of the narrator you will certainly have much to cheer about this collection for those who are determined to travel down the long winding road from start to finish although you may want to watch this in installments you will get a lot of good beatle exposure and information as the boys shot to fame in liverpool to their famous august swan song concert in san francisco label very bad film do not waste your time this film had poor video quality horrible acting an extremely weak story-line and it was directed poorly i understand that independent films do not have the budget or production values of industry-funded movies but even by indie film standards this movie was horrible i regret spending to watch this even at an amateur level the videography and acting are below standard the scenes are so badly done that i found myself chuckling during serious scenes i would not recommend that anyone watch this film label a bit pricey but cute you can find cheaper hats at target but this hat is cute cute cute if you have the extra cash lying around downside it doesn t have a strap to keep it attached to the baby label adorable i bought this hat for my month old who was quickly outgrowing all of his infant hats not only is this one cute and well made it stays on his noggin other hats seem to work their way off during the course of the day or migrate forward and cover his eyes the material is soft and cozy and we love that it isn t made in china label i love this hat this hat didn t fit my son until he was months for head size he looks like a real stud in it and gets nothing but compliments i love the color it goes well with many of his outfits he is now months still and the hat is getting tight and short other have mentioned folding the rim down to make it fit longer i think this makes the hat look weird and disproportioned i do wish the ears were more forward the ears are centered on the hat so when wearing it they are back by the crown of his head it would look cuter to have them more towards his temples to so could see them when looking directly at him though you can still see them i think this would improve the look overall great product label amazing charlie christian is incredible this is why history is so important to go discover a great talent such as this man he will blow your mind along the lines of robert johnson label terrific first novel keith scribner has written both a psychological drama and a suspense thriller in his first novel the goodlife based on an actual event begins with the kidnapping of a chemical company executive and follows the crime over a three day period the plot unfolds through the points of view of the five main characters moving the story forward from different directions to it s completion this is a very complex yet readable compelling story the writing is gritty riveting and true to life and mr scribner has a real talent for dialogue the characters are painstakingly drawn and developed and the scenes so vivid they almost jump off the page a tight suspenseful fast-paced page turner keith scribner doesn t disappoint label pretty pictures poor directions despite the very nice photos by mr brooks and mr cook some of the directions can be a bit misleading after following the directions from this book to kings creek falls i became considerably disoriented and only found the falls after consulting with other directions from online sources mark morrison s carolina guide has much better directions though less photographs online researching will also provide many many more than the falls located in the waterfalls of south carolina check on allen easler s website or the greenville online outdoors for more falls and hopefully better directions if you just want to look at the pictures though this is a nice little paperback label great value easy to use i purchased this scanner for the sole purpose of transferring old slides to a digital format after more than a hundred scans i have to say this is a wonderful item it is easy to use the software is simple though i have no comparison scans the image resolution exceeds expectations i scanned them at x a professional photographer might prefer a better model but for home scanning and transferring personal pictures the canon f is a great value my family and i enjoyed seeing full-sized pictures for the first time in decades label worth it for home use i recently purchased a new computer that came with of course windows vista unfortunately my old canoscan scanner was not compatible with this operating system so i started looking for a new one i really liked the old one so i stuck with canon and got the it s faster than the but is a bit bulkier and requires its own power outlet the was powered thru the usb good scanner but if i could have kept my i would have label canon scanner for the money it seems to do a very good job on photo reproduction as well as text a bit noisy but easy to operate label great scanner this scanner for the price is great it does exactly what i need for my type of work this is the second cannon product i have owned was not happy with my hp maybe it s time to change label great little scanner this is a nice little scanner it is small scans nicely easy to install and use i have vista and it wasn t really any problem to install the software i can t speak about the software b c i don t use it much i import into photoshop but it looks pretty simple to use the push buttons are a breeze to use i use this for my small business as my primary scanner and it works nicely good value overall label canon scanner good scanner with excellent resolution software is not user friendly too complex top of unit is curved and if desk space is an issue it wont support any thing on top of the unit negative and slide scanning a plus label canon canoscan ffcolor image scanner b002 i m a little disappointed in the canon scanner because i thought the advance in tecnoledge would have produced a better more advance product the white cover used to scan photos is a flimsy piece of cardboard which im sure will bend ware out or crease some place more frustrating is trying to put the flimsy piece back on label great everything as promised really easy to operate great quality of documents and pictures after scanning the scanner itself is very light and not bulky at all label does what s supposed to do well the results of the scans for all media negatives slides photos paper are very good the software user interface is a bit clumsy though i m sure canon can afford to spend a bit more to get software to match the hardware label this tv is terrible the dvd player hasn t worked since the first months i had it it constantly has to be unplugged and reset due to blue screen label extremely bad please do not buy this video it contains a very bad quality course of japanese including poor and old images japanese simbols on screen are almost impossible to read if you buy it you will loose your money label returned twice ordered chairs sat on them once and broke immediately they were replaced and i am softly sitting on them and not letting anyone over aprox lbs or so to sit on them if another breaks i will try to return them all for a refund label completely engaging original pull-you-along fiction i can t believe i let this book sit in my to be read pile for two years i was sucked into the story right away i don t know anything about painting or the dutch but this book is fantastic very funny and wonderfully detailed i am so intrigued by the author s mixing of fact and fiction time to do some sleuthing of my own on the internet label used but functional i purchased a used dual xdm7510 in dash cd mp3 wma receiver from crader electronics p c repair i rated it stars instead of only because it took a bit longer to arrive than the estimated shipping date and all the old solder-less crimp style connectors were left on i purchased this specific unit to replace the same style unit that quit working and the used one works just fine after installation it arrived clean and in good shape label fabulous we use ours very heavily ours is used for our ebay sales and sometimes is on and being used all day long it is one incredible machine far better than it s same priced competitors it comes with incredible software from newsoft vista scan with the scanner interface of presto image folio it is the simplest and best scanner software i have seen it eliminates the steps that is associated with adobe software buy it now john label a great idea wonderfully executed i bought this album being a huge metheny fan and it certainly lived up to my expectations to be very honest i was expecting something a little bit different more in line with the stuff that metheny plays with his group and so it took me a little time to appreciate its true beauty but over the last weeks the album has really grown on me nascente and sometimes i see are just superb wonderfully arranged and with great solos metheny s note choice on the whole is exquisite as usual and so is brecker s and hancock s james taylor also sings wonderfully on his two appearances lending a distinct charm to the album i would highly recommend this work to everyone label lullaby i put this cd on one evening and lay down to listen between sleep and awake it played while the curtains billowed as an ocean breeze came through the window it was perfect that memory will always define my assessment of this cd-a great lullaby label skip the beauty give me pretty there is so much potential in the lineup of this cd the singular talents of the instrumentalists the subtle and complex simplicity of the tunes the proven chemistry of the musicians well documented from numerous beautiful collaborations past the history alone that these artists have been steeped in but pretty is the password of the day here romantic sounds for a candlelit dinner numerous candidates for any best makeout tunes of all time compilations even james taylor s blessings to validate the safety factor of this project nearness of you has all this and less missing are fresh meaningful readings of the beautiful compositions any hint of lyric urgency or that sense of voice that makes a jazz ballad sing now i know that michael pat herbie charlie and jack have paid their dues and have proven they re beautiful artists just don t look to the ballad book as evidence you should buy this knowing the music is pretty and money is beautiful label don t waste your money do not waste your money on this it has the graphics of a gameboy advance buy a real game like halo or jedi academy label love in the midst of war i enjoyed this book so much that i purchased every book that i could find written by the author this is one of my favorite books by the author the book has an extremely well written storyline and i greatly enjoyed reading about the interaction between each of the major and minor characters i have never enjoyed reading about the american civil war however the author was able to capture my attention in this book i highly recommend this novel even-though it is a fictional account of the american civil war it is an exceptional account of the interaction between two men from opposite sides finding happiness together label total rubbish i should have known better although it s said you can t tell a book by its cover in the case of the low road i should have trusted my better instincts the cover is a dead give-away i love period fiction and i enjoy gay literature but this book is neither it s nothing more than the gay equivalent of a smutty bodice ripper all longing and panting it was all i could do to get through the first chapter before tossing this ridiculous book into the recycle bin label don t waste your money here this book is proof positive that the english are not entrepreneurs the book is very short with large typeset and poorly drawn illustrations conveying next to nothing label gps software it shipped quickly and got there when expected the problem is that the softwares manual is not very user friendly and can be confusing for st time users label are you kidding me i honestly do not know what topo us is good for i have hunted for hiking trails but haven t found any in my area or any area for that matter i have found pipelines and powerlines whooptie do also i use my garmin for road navigation i assumed that topo would overlay street maps wrong there are like a million little topo maps and i have to go into map setup and individually enable disable the maps a major pain when scrolling through maps the topo has streets but then are way out of date like years out of date and you have to look at the old roads when looking at topo data some friends had me do some searches on underwater wrecks for deep sea diving but they didn t come up i honestly don t know what this software is good for stars instead of one because there are topolines and mountian peaks label terrific young adult book under a bear moon is a wonderful paranormal tale on first glance you might expect a wearbear story to be all gruesome and blood and guts but nothing could be further from the truth with this book carrie masek has put together a sweet love story between two teenagers one of whom has a bit of a problem with being out after dark the story is well-crafted showing the blossoming love between greg and lynda as well as the difficulties of falling in love with someone who is well different i recommend it highly for anyone who enjoys romance and especially as a gift to a teenage girl label another great serie from the s this is another great series from the s but its a big big big shame that warner brothers cancled again a dvd release and i don t understand it i really would love to buy the whole serie on dvd sadly i m from switzerland and can t watching it online through amazon-video common wb give us fan s a chance label please hurry up it s half way through and still no falcon crest season i could be dead before i see this wonderful series again label dense essays about man s th century blahs there are very few books that i have been unable to finish because of ennui but this was one of them i made it about of the way through and had to call it quits this book badly needs editing percy asks some engaging questions to begin the book but it is all downhill from there label should not be listed in this category these are short pieces of movies about glen gould not paino music performences you don t see any real glen gould playing piano in this dvd in that regard i am dissapointed or i might have been misled to think these are some documentary films about glen gould actor colm feore s performences in hamburg and la concert are two of the interesting pieces to see but in my opinon this dvd should not be listed in the musucal and performing arts category where most people buy dvd s are ofter watch the performences again and over again such as glen gould s goldburg variations i centaily will not watch this dvd again label quite interesting it gave the dinosaurs a mind and a story it was humorus at times it was intertaining the animation was well done label vanessa s greatest the most talented miss america ever i didn t pay attention to vanessa williams records played on the radio untill i heard dreaming in the late s i was amazed at her beutifull sweet voice save the best for last and the sweetest days are my favorites also i still have to laugh when i hear colors of the wind played on the radio i remember when vanessa sang this song on the oscars and when she was done whoopi golberg said i always wanted to know what color my wind is label single layer release in america while the european pal format release is a dvd i e a double layer with gb of video and audio data they used a dvd i e a single layer disc for the ntsc release in america this means video has been recompressed and a lot of quality was lost i have not seen the pal release but i can assume the quality is so much better the music is excellent and the sound quality is very good despite the use of dolby digital instead of lpcm cd quality for the audio tracks label could have been stars the first dvd that i received had a momentary pause and then something flashed on the screen for a moment this appeared on any dvd player apparently some sort of a defect when putting the production together amazon replaced the disk without a problem but the replacement dvd predictably did the same i don t have the patience to keep returning the thing until the error is corrected that s a shame because the concert was different than most others a nice mix of anderson s lighter music and classics and quite enjoyable i would have rated this a if i could get a dvd that wasn t flawed label an awesome experience this dvd is awesome i m in awe of ian anderson and have been since the s but this took my enchantment to another level withthe classical part incorporated into the rock i thought it was well edited and included shots of the whole band i really gota kick out of the expressions on the orchestra s faces and how they were enjoying their experience as well if you re a fan ofjethro tull this will round out your collection label a great book froma great author hey all harlan ellison will be at the booksmith in san francisco for areading booksigning on september th at pmthe booksmith has set up a special ellison page highlighting the new

psych i just love these characters they remind me of me and my friends when we were younger label ordinary stories makes audience bored and silly this is one of the most flopped psych seasons series ever i was and still a big fan of shawn and gus but there are few stories in this season which make audience ridiculously bored and silly few of such are the amazing psych man tap-man dead man s curveball indiana shawn and the temple of let s doo-wap it again autopsy turvy and many more compared to earlier seasons in this season both shawn and gus are less-funny-more-silly forget about being interesting characters thus before buying it borrow it from the local library watch the episode then go for purchase because amazon still sells such an ordinary non-bluray season with pretty high price real value of such ordinary season should be around label love the show hate the download if you have the choice of waiting for the dvd s to be released wait the downloads are glitchy and frustrating to watch i have access to all levels of computers and had all of them do this from mac s to dells toshiba and asus very unhappy love the show and mad that i can t easily watch the season i need to to catch up with the series label awesome this show never fails to make me laugh always can identify with the s reference quips we absolutely love it label great if you have the rest of the series you won t want to miss out on this one i can t wait for the next season to come out on dvd label great fun for the whole family if you re looking for a fun show that everyone in the family can enjoy this is it you don t have to worry about off-color humor profanity scary scenes nudity sex drugs or anything else distasteful you might not want the little ones exposed to shows like this are a rarity these days label still great while not as funny as some of the previous seasons psych still makes us laugh every time shawn and gus are great together and the back-and-forth between the characters delivers even if the plots don t tickle your funnybone i know some people didn t like it but the hangover themed episode made us laugh till our sides hurt label don t buy it i agree with john bellis very strange and unintuitive interface maps not at all up to date customer support nonexistent wait up to an hour and then asked if want to spend dollars for support delorme makes microsoft seem bland when it comes to sucking more money out of users for upgrades you might note that they are not continuing this particular software road warrior i wonder why also you can use their software with other gps units but not their unit with other software the people who are giving favorable reviews must work for delorme label great product but buy it somewhere else i agree with all the recommendations but do not buy it on amazon i got it from home depot same bags days each same weight dimensions but it is only at home depot plus no for shipping if you have a home depot give them a call before blowing an extra bucks on this but do buy it they really work label easy installation scanner was very easy to install and use for the first time i am very pleased with it label don t buy this can lide was much easier to use software wise this program is so freakin over complicated its not menat for the busy person who needs hours to figure out its filing system the was much much better we wasted our money on this piece of crap label it s great i bought it based on other amazon reviews and the price i figured for the price if it is mediocre then so be it but actually i m quite happy with its performance and quality i specifically wanted it to scan in an extensive photo library as a way of fulfilling a new year s resolution to finally organize all those years of pictures it is serving this purpose quite well label avoid at all costs i bought two for bucks each but i think they cost less than a dollar to make i ve already exchanged the first pair i had and the new ones are just as bad or worse here are the defects i ve experienced so far the part where the microphone holder screws on has come loose and rotates freely this is one of the first two that i exchanged all of the adjustment knobs are different and none of them are easy to use some get in the way of each other when you re trying to secure it it s impossible to secure the rotation on the second pair i got the first were fine i m guessing this is another artifact of cheap manufacturing all of the adjustments are either loose or very tight to rotate some of them go from loose to stuck in just a few degrees of rotation there are many more defects but i m getting angry just writing about this recalling my futile attempts to get these set up summary avoid at all costs you re better off using duct tape and a broomstick label a walk down memory lane i was watching a u tube video about linda ronstadt and wondered if i could get a cd of hers i went to my favorite site amazon and typed it in up popped all her old records now on cd i had gotten rid of my record collection years ago because we live in an rv now and don t have the room i was excited about finding a collection of her best hits i didn t need all records again just my favorite ones they were all here on this one long playing cd life is good when you can put on a cd and relive those s s and your youth now i want to find the monkees oh joy label great cooking system it is very easy to assemble works great even under windy condition make sure you also purchase the cover to protect it from rusting label great burner this burner is built with very good quality easy to set up and very sturdy i use it in garage so no problem with the low flame it s about adjustable the heat is much stronger then the oven in kitchen great for any kind cooking very happy label indispensable if i lose power i can still cook i gave one to my sister too and they like it too label camp cbef explorer ordered just in time to use for a large gathering in conjunction with my wife s th birthday celebration with approximately friends and family in attendance using two large qrt stock pots and a cast iron skillet cooked a large batch of shrimp and grits with the camp chef for starters it took me no more than a few minutues to set it up and then i was cooking loved it set up ease of use results all fantastic can t wait to use it for future large gatherings very sold and sturdy i can tell it will serve me well for years to come label good steady pace this workout does incorporate some cardio segments which are not too complicated choreography wise but the main focus is the upper and lower body workout the compound movements e g dips from the step with biceps leg presses with delts are challenging without making you anaerobic the length minutes is good for a mid-week workout is it the most challenging weight workout no for those get the jari love dvds but is it a good weight workout for the intermediate to advanced exerciser yes if you re happy not being sore the next day stephanie is a good cuer and leader her voice is well modulated and not too peppy you will need an incline box i would recommend the transfirmer over the incline box and pound dumbbells why not stars the ab work as in the other firm workouts that do the ab work on the incline unless you have a death grip on the step you will slide down this makes them very awkward to do even with a mat on the incline label really needed a ghost writer too much back story too much opinining not enough story i got the part about how much the author believed in the mission but that became too repetitive so did the part about how evil saddam and his henchmen were i was an interrogator in iraq i know the back story i know about saddam i wanted to read this author s story but the writing quality just isn t there label this cd is great anyone who wants to be cheered up fast should get this cd it s the most uplifting cd ever if you like this one try all the other hanson cds you will not be disappointed also if you want something a tiny bit less poppy try the moffatts label too heavy to ship or carry bought this behemoth for a daughter going to study in spain took a bit to receive then realized it is so heavy that it cannot be shipped to spain reasonably it would cost as much as i bought it for one might think they would advise purchasers about this in advance since they proclaim themselves to be the overseas adapter experts it sits in its original unopened box in my garage i will sell to anyone wanting it for maybe label interesting the book was pretty good as i recall it was a while back when i read the book if i remember right the book seemed liked it ended too abruptly mazer left ya hanging but after searching on amazon i see why there s a sequel it was a good book overall p s if i recall corectly there was some mild profanity in it label incorrect fit bought this item readily after the amazon website confirmed its the right fit for my vehicle when it arrived i opened the package only to realize that it had a male connector the one in my car the faulty one has a female connector please be mindful of this while ordering label shallow water this is a grossly dishonest work dealing with the historical jesus herzog fails to credibly deal with the relevant nt textual matter not to mention addressing and genuinely interacting with scholarship that finds much more to the historical jesus than herzog s unplatable academic gruel indicates he has very little to say about very much one can thus wade through the shallow waters of herzog s prophet and teacher never getting one s feet wet try the following for a good trip through the land of modern historical jesus scholarship jesus and the eyewitnesses the gospels as eyewitness testimonydale g skip wagner jr label a fair product this is a good product i have used this product for one year and already i m typing words per minute i started last year sixth grade and i m typing almost as fast as my mom this game is really fun because you learn while playing games label five star great award winning british film probably why it cost so much superior photography superior acting but it was so much more expensive from amazon than many other british films label are you serious i heard such wonderful things about this movie and was really looking forward to seeing it i had a couple friends over to watch it and out of the four of us i was the only one left awake to see the end i was so disappointed the movie was too long and left me feeling cheated at the end so gald i didnt buy it rent it first before buying label it does not work dvd would not work in any of my players even the new ones it came with a little note in it that tells you you need new software to get it to run in most dvd players i am returning it label simply the most beautiful movie ever made this is by far the most beautiful movie ever made e m forster s masterpiece is lovingly brought to the screen by merchant-ivory and an impeccable cast if you somehow fail to fall in love with this film you have no soul the writing is superb sets and scenery divine and casting dead-on label terrible bd transfer i bought the special edition bbc video blu-ray version that bears the following caveat due to the age and nature of the film you may notice occasional flaws in the image and sound quality wherever possible we have sought out and restored the original materials to ensure the best possible quality this is no restored version the blu-ray version was no better than a dvd version i was terribly disappointed sony should guard it s blu-ray reputation label simply spiffing a dreamy delight the original quintessential merchant-ivory film helena bonham carter as the lovely and lost miss lucy honeychurch on holiday in florence with her cousin played by dame maggie smith with daniel day-lewis at his most uptight and the only role julian sands can be proud of when i was my best-friend and i would put on our best victorian threads and eat chocolates while we savored freddy s hair lucy s temper and poor charlotte not to mention george label terribly done shipping was fast however it was terribly done the gold tone was not flat and with a lot of bubbles inside so it make the pin looks very cheap label great buy i am very happy with yall guys and from my family i would like to say thank you for all your help i will make sure to tell everyone to buy from yall all label this year s downer i enjoyed this book but expected more from it than i got the characters were well developed but seem to sleep walk through the story there was no real heat between the main characters they seemed to seek each other out for warmth and comfort not because they truly cared about each other which is ok i guess if you re into that sort of thing some of the scenes in the book were brutal like the west is was back then but the characters seemed to hold back their emotions from everyone including us label bogus i ordered this cd and expected it in a short period of time per the ad after three months i was notified that amazon could not locate the item and my order was cancelled that same day i saw the same item on amazon available for shipping in business days at to times the price when i ordered it label incorrect information i bought this atlas several months ago and loved it however i just discovered a major mistake on page birmingham is listed as the capital of alabama i checked elsewhere to make sure that the capital had not moved from montgomery if this basic information is incorrect it makes me wonder how many other errors exist and if i can trust only the information that i know from other sources very disappointing label doesn t seem to do much i haven t really seen any evidence that using this product actually does anything my filters still get mildewy and the water if left sitting for more than a day or two does the same i suspect bleach would actually work better and be a much cheaper option label slow and unsatisfying movie was slow and hard to watch not very satisfying would have made a better tv show than a full length movie label put me to sleep within minutes i was dozing looked over and my husband was asleep as well very boring turned it off label good acting but very boring if you re looking for a suspenseful movie don t look here the acting is good but there is no suspense because it s slow character driven drama that is base on murder that doesn t unfolds until the very end of the movie label slow dull the fact that it s a true story makes it interesting alone but the plot line the music the build us is unfortunately off in a variety of ways i really wanted to like this movie but didnt as a movie it just falls short the characters needed a bit more development and the casting was just not as good as it could have been kristen dunst does a good job but really the movie and story is bizarre so even her acting couldnt pull this movie out label should have followed by instincts and stopped watching i usually don t write reviews for amazon but this movie was so bad i wanted to try to save others from my misery of the way through i was really tempted to stop watching but kept telling myself that it might get better it never did i have amazon prime so i m not out any money but i did waste my time label unable to care about the characters while others see gosling as having done a great job my own response is that he did if what he was going for was boring his character should have been interesting instead i found it so boring that it was impossible for me to believe in dunst s devotion to him as a result i didn t care about any of the characters i found the movie long boring and disjointed label very good text book it is a very good text book but the pictures would be colored color pictures are important for the patologist veterinary and for the students label book of lilies i bought this book because i was interested to know about the different kind of lilies this book has beautiful picture of them label great buy wonderful buy i got this upon hearing the very sad news about ronnie james dio and his death rock and roll will never be the same again but the seller was great and very fast shipping i would definetly reccomend this seller label muddled thinking crass inelegant style reviewed by a woman i struggled through the first thirty pages but could not get through the bad writing he distorts the concept of manhood assuming it to be the most negative and degenerate form of masculinity and then goes ahead to deconstruct it man-haters will love it men searching for the meaning of manhood will waste their time with it label rubbish i am sorry i bought it what a waste of money and time predictable made for television junk jane horricks is a wonderful actor but has chosen poorly the films she has starred in she would be better off for having passed on this label read before ordering this cd as an avid fan of slot and video poker software i was extremely disappointed with this product the entire cd only had games on it one video poker machine and two slot machines no wonder it only took about seconds to install this cd has more film clips and adds pushing a trip to vegas than it has the actual games themselves do yourself a favor do not order this product label c est brigitte at times i can t really comprehend brigitte bardot s fame she s sexy yes and a fairly okay actress but as a singer she s just alright her music is not essential but if you are into s french music it s not all that bad there are some great songs on this disc not really worth buying the whole album but still a fun listen label simply horrible if there was star i would have given star instead of star this earrings are horrible and times smaller than what looks in pic i had bought engagement ring from amazon and had a great experience so went for this one but ended up returning this item as soon as i got it even for bucks i wouldn t buy these earrings label got what i paid for the price was too good to be true although the size of the diamonds is accurate they lack sparkle my cz s are prettier fortunately these were for my year old daughter i didn t to spend a great deal in case she lost one i wouldn t recommend buying any diamonds that fall this low on the color scale label horrible do not waste your time please don t make the mistake i did by ordering these earrings i did not read the reviews of other people regarding these as i should have they do not look at all like real diamonds they do not sparkle they honestly look like stones made out of plastic although plastic might shine more than these they are not worth the money at all label do not order this item the quality is simply terrible they were so cloudy you almost would have thought they weren t even diamonds also one of the two had a black fleck in it too label poor color i expected these earrings to be small but the color and clarity is much worse than i expected the diamonds look milky white and have not sparkle i would not spend a dime on this piece label worst looking diamond i have ever seen i saw the negative reviews and despite them decided to give these a shot the second i took them out of the package i knew that they were going right back these are utterly the worst looking diamonds i have ever seen even for i am not a diamond expert but a diamond should not a have milky white color the good thing is amazon makes returns easy label not good for vga presentations we bought this projector for training presentations we are now in the processes of returning it the year old projector we have has a more legible text output i m not sure what the problem is from other reviews this projector is great for movies if you are looking for a vga presentation projector this is not the solution label very bad quality i placed an order to buy these stickers with red arabic letters for my white apple wireless keyboard but what i received was with white letters so they didn t work fortunately i have a macbook pro with black keyboard so i decided to use them but each sticker can cover about of each key as a result i threw them in the trash the worst thing that happened after this purchase was when i received and email from amazon market place asking me to rate this order and the seller so i wrote exactly what i mentioned above the next day i received an email from the seller who insisted that it was my mistake because i ordered stickers with white letters not red and that i needed them for my pc not for my mac plus the way that the seller has wrote their email to me was very rude and i saved their email well i m writing a review right now on the product that i purchased which indicates that it is with red letters not white label umax astra u the scanner has never scanned since new i can understand a unit being shipped factory without firmware mistakes happen but the umax customer service is just plain lousy the get them off the phone and don t answer e-mails policy is an insult i ll pay a little more and by an office hp label umax products ucks do not buy umax products it is a total waste of money most of the time the drivers and software provided by the company does not work with the operating system you are using in order for it to work properly you must go to their web site and download a patch that supposed to fix the problem but instead the patch conflicts with other softeware such as camera software or even the operating system one more thing the drivers and patches at their website are not free i wrote to umax and they have never responded to any of the emails i have sent to them i decided to call the support center and i was refered back to the website to download another patch very bad customer support label scanner is very picky i bought this scanner several years ago and have felt like i wasted my money it did okay under windows se but i had problems getting it to work under windows pro i had to download the w2k software drivers none provided with the original cd which took forever of course to make matters worse i upgraded my computer last month from a pii to an amd xp with an asus a7s333 motherboard gb maxtor hard drive and mb kingston ddr ram i kept the same video card dvd cdrw drives etc i reloaded windows loaded the software drivers and nothing happened after trying for a week i gave up i tried to find updated drivers on the umax site but no they wanted me to fork over money to ship a cd to me harrumph so it now sits on the floor and acts as a cat perch that s about all it s worth label good scanner with decent software package i ve used this scanner for over a year now and find the total package to be quite good the scanner tends to scan images a bit dark but that is easily corrected with the included imaging software i actually use paintshop pro to adjust the brightness the ocr omnipage le does a fairly good job but free ocr software will never be the match of programs i scan images almost exclusively for posting to websites the scans are fairly quick even with the second warm-up for the first scan you get quite a bit of bundled software some of which is redundant how many graphics programs do you really need i use the copy utility much more than i thought i ever would i even put a shortcut of the copier on the desktop so i can copy quickly in short this is a pretty good scanner with some decent included software and a great usb interface label the men s house brilliant i am a master mason in southern california who has read studied countless masonic writings tests and books many are hokie many are incorrect however every once in awhile a great piece of work comes along the men s house is one of these works this book was written to be enjoyed understood by everyone masons non-masons alike if you would like a peek into the world that masons enjoy wish upon the rest of humanity this is the one very inspirational thought provoking this book is a must-read must-own chris label memories that last a lifetime i watched all these videos as a child and they began a lifelong love of natural science for me they have a way of making science interesting for children i recommend them i m getting all nostalgic now label the oval was broken im getting really tired of this there is no need to say any more broken i have to write words on broken the rack cant even be used with that dish broken by the way one of the lids is too small label save the shipping and handling charges this is a great product as all corningware is but why buy it from target and pay almost in shipping and handling when you can buy it direct from amazon and it qualifies for free super savings shipping label old school flavor w new school hits art official intelligence who would have thought that de la would have stood so strong the new album is fresh and innovative with hooks that are off the hook various artists that appear on tracks add flavors of r b as well as old school rap thank you beastie aoi gives us somthing to think about as well something to dance to change of pace thanks to de la label i m partial to this album because i m a de la head i love all of de la s albums as any native tongues junkie would i have all dela albums sitting right next to the tribe latifah and jungle brothers collections clearly feet high and rising is everyone s favorite de la album but if you re old school how can you not like de la favorite tracks on this cd set the mood thru ya city all good and copa label remarkable abide with me is remarkable just over-the-moon good this is what real writing and perfect storytelling are all about liz strout definitely has the gift label spirtitual inadequacy and redemption i really enjoyed strout s earlier novel amy and isabelle so when this book came out seven years later i was willing to give it a read sight unseen abide with me is a testament to strout s skills she manages to get an avowed secular humanist me to dive deeply into this portrait of a congregational minister and father who is in deep mourning for his wife feeling that his travails are minor compared to the losses that others throughout history have faced he starts to lose faith in himself eventually his daughters and congregation also begin to lose their faith in him as well although the book deals with inner turmoil there is a lot of dryly spun new england humor in it as well a leavening that makes for a very satisfying prose mixture i just hope that i don t have to wait another seven years for strout s next gem of a novel label left me cold it s so fascinating to read reviews by ordinary readers like all of us not literary reviews human nature is so diverse the latest edition of the new yorker gave a very favorable review of this book but for me i don t know that this was the worst book i ve read in the last few months but it came close i couldn t have been less interested in the characters the subject matter the location the whole book left me cold i have read comparisons to gilead a wonderful book abide with me is not in the same league not even playing the same game label mega marbles new generation marble set not a good choice for our little grandchild as the marbles are too big to use in quercetti marble run with motorized elevator sad part is it broke that other game on christmas day label tells the untold story of the holocaust piotrowski masterfully discusses and documents many topics usually avoided in traditional holocaust education these include the collaboration of jews with both nazis and communists the murder of million polish gentiles by the germans and the deportation of million polish gentiles to siberia by the russians where most of them diednot in gas chambers but from disease and starvation must read for anyone interested in then full account of the holocaust label where s the dial indicator looked like a nice enough scale but it had no indicator after a few quick shakes i heard it rattling around around inside the scale thank god for amazon s easy return policy label horrible horrible horrible this has to be one of the worst books ever written i spent almost on this book and felt totally ripped off brad knight speculates on what he felt like happened to laci and why scott did it etc i don t care what he speculates happened to laci i want facts and there wasn t any given in this book he then goes on to bore us about his take on the o j simpson murder case as if this has anything to do with the peterson case-don t ask he rambles on and on about his theories on both of these cases but his theories are based on speculation rumors etc the fact the title of the book is laci peterson the whole story is a joke the book ends even before the trial he is supposedly going to write a second book to finish where the first book ended boy that s one book i won t be buying if you want to read the definitive book on the laci peterson murder case read catherine crier s great book a deadly game label couldn t even finish the book i bought this book in hopes that it would offer additional insight into the laci peterson case i paid around for this book and couldn t even finish it the author included all these personal stories about himself that had nothing to do with the case at all there were so many stories about himself that i found myself skipping through the book just trying to find content about the actual case i finally said enough and put it away for good i let my aunt have it and she only got through the second chapter my advice is to save your money label book was ok software was not this book was useful but the software was a disappointment the sofware was not very similar to the actual gre test label good product the other plastic garages and service stations that we have purchased in the past were made so poorly but this one has really stood the test of time with two kids under the age of five label not fine jewelry i was looking for some nice jewelry to give our and year old nieces this is not it this will end up as a present for the year old niece because we got it at the friday sale price of the pendant is smaller than the on-screen picture smaller even than the fingernail on my ittle finger and the stone is so small it is hard to see if i had paid the they ask for it regularly i would have been even more disappointed and asked for a refund evven at only i am tempted to send it back label this show is not okay its a very violent show that leaves you feeling horrible every time you watch it the main characters get away with killling drug dealing shooting young boys with all the tragedies in our country this show is an extremely violent and bad example to the young generation who may be watching the only proper ending would be for the main characters to get caught by the dea label such a great show this series is starting out to be as good as the previous that captured my attention with the removal of gustavo from the picture the scare element of before is mostly gone but they were able to successfully add to the existing drama that seemed to end in season good times label great show the good well written and acted show plot twists real enough the bad not one of the characters is a good person like parts bad qualities to part redeeming qualities this show creates anxiety which i guess could count as a good just as easy label great series riviting next to dexter this is my favorite program this certainly beats watching the election campaign and conventions hope they make another season label little sparkling gems i just received these earrings amazingly quickly from amazon thank you and i really love them they are tinier than i expected but they still look beautiful as i prefer small earrings the sapphires are deep blue almost black but they shine in the light due to their beautiful facets the diamond in the middle is tiny but it lightens the flower i ll try to buy the other same earrings with ruby and emerald label might be a good product but the nozzle arrived obliterated in pieces the box was fine so i do not blame ups might have been damaged from the warehouse and shifting destroyed it actually it looks like someone took the nozle off stepped on it then stuck it in the box i m not saying that s what happened but you get the idea of what it looked like the nozzle is important on this so it is now useless these things happen i understand but beware this is not returnable due to being classified as hazardous i can t see how this could be classified as such but i did not see it i guess that is my fault for not reading the whole page however i have to rate this as an amazon fail left a packaging feedback but no response is promised or likely i can t find a customer service link to talk to someone about it i will update my rating if this is resolved but it doesn t look good right now label gran colecci n disfrut completamente de este lbum aqu est n las

mi vida12 mi cafetal label breast cancer husband s get this book you ll need this advice one way or another there are some topics you may not want to deal with but trust me you will deal with them your wife s cancer diagnosis doesn t come with a manual this book is a great start even though you wish you weren t reading it once the dust settles you ll be thankful for it label so very helpful my husband is not a book reader but he read this book cover to cover it scared him but let him know what to expect he was a wonderful caretaker this book helped him get ready and know what to do as well as what not to say we give it to other couples that have been diagnosed label price and results a double threat treatment the price of this eye creme is outstanding then i tried it and it is the best eye creme i ve ever used i normally spent on eye treatments and now i don t have to i will never switch from v tae eye treatment i am hooked label you re going to want this strategy guide if you want access to the best wanzer in the game as usual nothing about this game is hard enough to warrant a strategy guide but you re going to want this one if you want to get your hands on the best wanzer in the game the hoshun there are also a lot of other secrets that you might miss if you don t at least have this guide handy label great movie i watched this movie not knowing what to expect but by the end of this movie i was in love with it it is a great story a little tragic but still worth the time to watch it label could of been great the first seven pages of this book made me believe it would be a real page turner after that things went amiss you never really discover what motivated certain main characters to behave the way they did or why you also never find out what happened to certain characters they are just dropped i also expected a book that involved werewolves throughout although that too left me disappointed the worst of it was all the type o s i found it got to the point where i just wanted to start circleing them out of frustration i could go on but then i would give away the entire story line and if any one is still interested in reading this book that would be unfair label not just lycanthropes gripping horror is often about the desires both positive and negative surrounding the family such is the case with richard leefs novel a tale of brotherly competition gone bad illuminated by the supernatural when a down-on-his-luck photographer accidentally shoots photos of a murder he becomes the target for supernatural vengeancecor was he the target to begin with the werewolf is perhaps one of those classic monsters most rich with symbolic possibilities and lee employs here an interesting conceit when horror works it not only scares us it illuminates something dark in all of us we look forward to more from this writer label guilt by association i think anyone reading this book will feel that they have been made to feel guilty to me more than trying to help with these feelings the book does more to bring them to your attention and you begin to think omg what am i doing with my kids and i should feel guilty about it the book is an easy read and does not do much to answer any questions in my opinion it may make you feel better however because it says its ok to feel guilty in the end the book did little for me label outstanding book an outstanding book i myself knew absolutely nothing about electricity when i first bought this book although obviously it didn t make me an expert it nonetheless taught me what i needed to know to start modifying my boat s electrical systems i admit that i am biased don casey is one of my favorite sailing authors but if you are a novice and need to upgrade your boat s electrics this is the book to get label doesn t work not worth the money i purchased this as a gift and we were excited to start using it right away however our potatos were a little old and starting to go soft but we thought why not even with softer potatoes this was horrible to use took so much effort to push the potato through and the end was never completely cut not being ones to give up we cleaned it up not easy to do by the way and put it aside until we had new potatos to see if that made a difference it did not trying to line everything up pushing etc was difficult we then tried the smaller blade for smaller fries thinking perhaps it was the blades but that was even worse just a horrible waste of money ended up returning it would not recommend label worst junk ever worst piece of chinese junk i ever purchased only fits half of a potatoe and can t even stand up to that i used it three times and the handle broke a blade bent and came out and the blade frame cracked save your money and leave this one in china label weekend cook sorry but this is a total piece of junk i guess you really do get what you pay for don t waste your money spend a little more and get quality label poor construction quality i purchased this item after reading the positive reviews here at amazon it arrived today and i am pretty disappointed about the poor quality of construction the box overall is somewhat flimsy and can easily be twisted and bent it feels like thin leather wrapped over a cardboard body frame the latch sticks so it doesn t operate smoothly or easily and the lid doesn t open quite enough to balance properly so it sometimes falls closed by itself on the plus side the interior pockets and features are nicely appointed in cushy-soft velvet and the watch holders fit my watches nicely and snugly i had thought that at this median price the build quality and fit finish would be better it is disappointing enough that i will probably buy something else label a must-have for wisconsin winter i ve had yaktrax before and wore them out after several winters i use them when shovelling and walking my dogs these are great on icy roads or sidewalks i can slip them onto my sneakers or boots buy a size larger if your boots are heavily insulated with large soles and no longer ice skate when walking label great item to survive the winter i bought these before here in town and loved them the pair i originally bought still are great i needed a couple of pair to place strategically at work and in the car in the event of snow and i wasn t ready now i m ready these yaktrax are great for those hard to see places is is just wet or is is ice i don t have to worry if i have these on they provide great grip and give me more confidence when walking warning don t wear them on tile or hard wood floor you ll slip and fall not to mention possibily damage your floor label great when they work these things work great when they aren t falling off your boots due to the rubber bands breaking i am a police officer in alaska and items like these are a necessity due to the weather however i was only able to wear these on shift times before the rubber bands broke i m quite disappointed in the lack of quality not the performance the materials they use are cheap some rubber and thin metal wire the unit cost to make these i bet are in the cent range and they charge somewhere near i would gladly pay all day long if the product had good durability label exceptional i am as good as consumer reports but cheaper these aregreat convenient light weight durable effective not for in-door use therefore must be put on where in a cold garage and taken off in a cold garage forexample which isn t ideal if the yaktrax are wet andcold and iced up but my best friend could have used a pair recentlywhen he was simply fetching mail broke his leg inthree places on an icy path label months tops the product absolutely works but you re lucky if you get more than months out of a pair all they would have to do is solder weld the wires closed but instead they have very strong lose sharp wires wrapped around rubber also the product has a tenancy to fall off your shoes midstride at random times do not buy label yaktrax walker durability i was very excited when i first tried on the yaktrax walkers i have a very steep driveway clearing off snow can get very challenging with slippery winter weather the yaktrax walkers worked great the first time the second time i used them they also fell off a couple times the third time i used them the sturdy outerband broke not sure how they can call it sturdy if you plan on using these for anything substantial i would recommend looking at a different product label safe and secure in my s i had a very serious fall on black ice since then anytime i knew there was going to be icy weather or anytime there was melted snow that would freeze overnight i was fearful of going out for anything i ve already used my yaktrax this year and i m no longer afraid i feel safe and secure and look forward to stepping out they re great thank you label new to winter having moved from florida to upstate ny with no knowledge of winter the traction cleats have been a life saver since i don t always want to wear large snow boots these cleats make it easy for me to wear more fashionable shoes and still make it to my car in one piece on those cold icy mornings label these really work i have problem ankles my ligaments have been rebuilt by basket-weaving them with a tendon one of my ankle tendons has been shatter and removed stability is vital to my safety i am amazed on how well yaktrax supplies firm footing before using yaktrax i felt a prisoner of winter now i am no longer homebound during snow days i feel free to venture out label excellent product this is an excellent product for anyone who lives where it snows or it s icy last year i slipped on our ice in the driveway so i thought i d give these a try it s just like walking on dry land incredible they are easy to put on but definetly take them off in your garage or outside before you walk into your house because they will rip the crap out of your flooring label no more worries on the snow and ice after a slip and fall on the ice in the middle of the street in front of a bus i became terrified of any spot on the ground that appeared wet i told my doctor about my fall and she suggested yak trax of course i laughed at the name but went on line and ordered tried them out and loved them label safely walk on snow and ice yaktraxs are lightweight and easily stretch over shoes and boots they give excellent tractionon ice or snow a must for anyone especially if you live where snow and ice are a commonoccurance a great product label a winter essential in certain parts of north america if you walk on ice you ll find these very nice and much less expensive than a broken bone label one month only these last about a month had to get total of six of them for my parents to last through the winter guessing this is their profit strategy label definitely recommend i ran outside the entire winter with these on my sneakers and they work awesome in the snow and ice i did go through a pair but with as much as i used them it was to be expected label great safeguard against ice i only got to use these once before all the snow melted but now i feel confident that i m ready for next year i ride at a local barn and even where paths have been plowed it s often slippery i keep the yaktrax with my tack they are easy to slip on over my riding boots and i feel secure enough to fetch the horse from the paddock as well as make trips between my car and the barn when i am done i can slip the yaktrax off rinse them off when i clean my boots and they are ready for the next use i had already fallen flat on my back earlier this winter so it was a great relief to get the yaktrax so promptly after ordering them label indiferent product laudable service bought the two dvd set the exercises were a bit softer than what i was looking for seemed to be aimed at continous gentle movement rather than stretching into and maintaining positions there did seem to be the advertised several hours of viewing however the menu navigation did not respond well either to playing on my computer or my dedicated dvd player gave up trying after a while contacted the producer and prompt restitution was made five stars for service label revealing i knew one woman at work was trash talking about me and the book bully in sight suggested there was a co-bully involved this book helped me understand and identify the co-bully middle bee and what her function was in the scheme of things she was someone i thought was a friend pumping me for information which she fed back to the queen bee it also helped me recognize who the afraid-to-bees were and cut them all off i now understand their ways well enough to go forward and turn them all in to management should they start mis-behaving again towards any one in my organization not just me label simply yuck it does not taste well i was expecting real sprouts and better seasoning but it was not simply that great label don t waste your money i think hot wheels has some great stuff out there but this is definately not one of them putting it together is a pain in the neck it s very hard to click every together and the instructions could not be more unclear be aware that the pieces do not come out again so you re stuck with this large contraption to store afterwards there is only one function pull the truck back on the lever and try to hit the monster s chest so we did but it was virtually impossible to do the truck keeps falling in the pit and gets eaten every time it s just poorly designed it s very loud and my intelligent year old stopped playing after minutes label the running man special edition my husband is a great arnie fan and enjoys any of his movies this is just another example of another label varley s best collection if you re tired of namby-pamby upbeat sf in future perfect tense this book is for you i can t believe it is out of print it should be required reading for any true fan of science fiction the stories are enthralling the characters lives are compelling you ll lose yourself in varley s vision label dreadful video playback netflix et al work great at our home but amazon video sucks this movie was unwatchable it was such bad video quality label does not last i bought this heavy duty uv treated tarp to cover some equipment that gets virginia sun two-thirds of the day less than a year later it was completely rotted away i bought a second tarp off amazon not realizing i was ordering the same one the heavy-duty uv treated sold me again same thing happened it is months later and the tarp is rotting out with holes a couple of feed across so unless you intent to use this in the shade to protect only from rain i d suggest a different brand label bbq grill cover well worth the extra money my grill is like another child to me only the best best best best best best best label where were the funny parts the glowing reviews on the cover made this book sound like a fun read it wasn t this book really challenged my attention span i kept wondering if it was ever going to get better summary mischevious writer sets up another one to be murdered just for fun the hit men completely unbelievable cultured theatre lovers turn out to be the nicest people in the story this was the first martha grimes i have read and i am in no hurry to try another i happen to love subtle humor but this was so subtle i missed it label arbitrary conclusions difficult to read there aren t many books i just don t like but this was one rapaille comes across as an elitist who s tricked everyone into believing he s a guru i would compare rapaille to some know-it-all expert at the art gallery who raves about the artist s use of light color and internal meaning only to find out later that the painting was done by an elephant with a brush in its trunk i e waaaay too much meaning assigned to random things the same is true here rapaille s conclusions are ambiguous and unproveable and you or i could spout the same arbitrary theories for example because americans consume a lot of hamburgers i hereby declare that the culture code for america is a cow see it s easy this type of random link between unrelated things and the unsupportable claim that they re not random and they are related is what you get with this book rapaille s only genius is in convincing corporate america that he is one label too short no elasticity title pretty much covers it they are way too short so the wrist knuckle coverage is minimal and there is no elasticity so you can t get a tight secure fit don t bother label aly and aj the best amazing i haven t even bought the cd yet and i m addicted to it i go on websites to listen to samples of the songs ratings-rush no one collapsed something more on the ride speak for myself out of the blue in a second i am one of them sticks and stones protecting me slow down do you believe in magic walking on sunshine that was my review hope it helped you out alexandra label how did you and your sister start singing together how did you and your sister aj start singing together what age did you guys start label how i envy their composing brilliant wow oh my wow these are the thoughts that were going through my mind when i first listened to the whole cd of into the rush by aly aj it s really cool to think that two girls only a little older than i can really make this kind of music it s awe inspiring honestly i agree with eri hong kong she really summed it up in her review all i want to add is that when you listen to this kind of music it kind of lifts your heart up raises your spirits and it just makes you feel like suddenly so many more things are possible that probably sounds cheesy doesn t it isn t it weird how something so cheesy can be so true please at least listen to this cd i m telling the truth when i say that it is awesome label pop doesn t get much worse what do you expect from a band who s main audience is radio disney for some dome reason this pathetic sister duo decided to promote their music to ccm audience they even brought on famed producer ian eskelin for a few songs what does it amount to one of the worst albums of the year the covers throw rotten eggs at the original versions and the stench seeps through the rest of the songs the music is terrible the songwriting is terrible their voices aren t anything to write home about and the lyrics are downright pathetic why buy it don t boycott it what s christian about this music what s even good about it by the way their new album only expands on the bad parts it might be so bad it s burnable label view only with a mega screen with mega sound system i saw this short short film years ago at a theatre at that time this short was a as prelude to a feature length film and it was unique at that time and thus enjoyable recently i this film on video on both a regular inch tv and wide screen tv connected to a powerful audio system if you do not have the wide screen tv and great audio system do not bother the quality of this film is quite poor compared to the crystal clear clarity of most claude lelouch films plus it just does not work on the small screen bigger the viewing and hearing platform that more enjoyable the viewing au revoir label trailer unplugged i haul a boat enclosed utility and a snowmobile trailer and need this adapter for my chevy avalanche cheaply built and all of my flat prong trailer plugs frequently work themselves loose and disconnect amazon offers others for a few dollars more pay the difference and get one of the better adapters unless you enjoy being unplugged label worked as they should one of my sons bought these extra air burst rockets and the other accessories as well they make for a lot of fun if you have a larger open area label the reviews are written by the author i am merely in the process of conducting a search but the fact that the author has written the reviews himself and refers to himself in the third person for one review causes this marketer to not be interested in what he has to say how ridiculous note the review requires selecting a rating i have not actually read the content which may be quite good label good stuff it works surprisingly well on my z top it went from gray back to black and it looks like a band new top label the beautiful gretchen mol this reviewer thought that gretchen mol s performance in the notorious betty page in the title role was spirited and breathtaking the story and script was not over the top and non-exploitive and it did capture a slice and time of american history culture the post wwii america s when life seemed tame safe and somewhat boring it was nice to see when contemporary america at the time had these slight aberrations of slight deviant behavior simmering underneath the country questioning decency and morals in society right before the s counter-culture was about to emerge overall a great cast decent script and cinematography capturing the look and feel of the s and the beautiful gretchen mol capturing the look and spirit of the queen of the golden age of pin-up girls label keeping your eye on the actor a charming stimulating and engrossing film that provides a surprisingly heartwarming take on an extraordinary person as others have mentioned the acting is superb this ultimately satisfying film captures her innocence her mischief and a vivid snapshot of the indulgences and controversies of the time label great read mediocre advice i purchased this book a little while before going to paris and read it cover to cover made maps reference marks on my maps basically went over board believing i had invested money in a guide that was somewhat acurate sadly i was mistaken many of the stores mentioned were either no longer in business or were at another address most of the advice was off the cuff and not honest enough to be taken seriously by anyone it is a fun read don t get me wrong but more as fiction than fact paris is a living breathing animal of a city always changing i realize now that advice not military precision shopping is what i am looking for and this is not it label musica popular de los andes is a bootleg this cd is another of the series of bootlegs that came in from italy in the mid s featuring yma sumac selling or buying it is illegal and it has no business being available on amazon com all of yma sumac s early material is owned by capitol records emi and without exception every legitimate pressing bears their trademark while this one does not buy it at your own risk label i really enjoyed this book i met scott haskins at his book reading signing in philadelphia a few months ago he had his sister do his book reading and you would have thought she was sasha as she read with so much character and feeling the haskins are a very talented family anyway i had to buy this book because she stops reading when sasha opens the door to the bedroom with surpise then all hell breaks loose i loved this book because there is a little bit of sasha in all women there were times i felt like taking a few of my friend s family s lovers husbands out but sasha had enough nerve to go to the next level she was about it bout it hey scott i look forward to seeing you at our sistahs with a vision august barbecue in new jersey i have selected this book for my selection in both my reading groups busara nayo is my other group label sasha s way this book was a very good book i couldn t hardly put the book down sasha was a killer to her heart even though some of the men did need killing it would have been good to have a sasha s two to see if she really did stop killing label something different i must say this book was very well different from what i m used to reading and even though this review is late as in date i was just able to find it since amamzon was sold out the cover and the beginning chapter captured my attention but the story line lacked something what that is i don t know label better than live well the cd is better than their live show i saw her band in victoria b c canada on holiday in and michelle morand s singing was really off key like scratching down the chalk board off-key i m glad the mp3s are better but still i agree with another review that it needs to be polished i really like the lyrics she wrote maybe she could write music for other singers she s got good stories in her songs i don t think they re together anymore after the cd cause i went to her website and it s old stuff from label needing polish while the content within the songs of the album are intelligent most of the vocal tracks were surprisingly unpolished it is with wonder that the producer of the album did not take the time to either suggest more work on the vocals as oftentimes the vocalist is unable to reach a solid note or to completely redo various tracks to cover up the lack of strength and range a typical album typical genre of low grade music styling and just overall typical not one of my favourites but everyone wants to be a star eh label i tried but couldn t get rid of the odor i really wanted to love this tea kettle it is so gorgeous unfortunately like many other reviews stated it has a bad chemical odor that just wouldn t go away i washed it boiled full pots of water boiled a water vinegar mix a few times and even let lemons soak in it the smell just wouldn t go away i made some tea and tried to ignore it but i just couldn t get the chemical smell and taste to dissipate label returned i bought this electric kettle and promptly returned it the water that i boiled had a strange chemical smell like burning plastic i tried using vinegar baking soda etc to remove the unpleasant taste but it didn t work i purchased a breville stainless steel electric kettle instead there aren t any unpleasant tastes with the stainless steel kettle label good product but always breaks cheaply made i purchased two of these through a local retailer the first one broke at the handle where the button is and stopped working altogethe it would start up and then turn off randomly so it could never complete a heating cycle it lasted for months to a year the second one i got as a replacement broke at joint where the lid attaches to the top so it just falls off when pouring unless you want to hold it in place and burn your hand periodically yesterday it started leaking between the black base and bottom of the glass after hearing reviews of their customer service i haven t bothered to complain about a replacement i am looking for an alternative i liked the product otherwise it s a shame it s so cheaply or badly made label no significant improvement in awful taste after all these reviews unfortunately like so many other reviewers i am turned off and very disappointed that capresso hasn t resolved the problem of the chemical plastic whatever is causing the ill-taste of the water after boiling we don t know if there is any health danger as a result of whatever is causing the ill-taste the pot is attractive and heats quickly which are great selling features but the taste doesn t let up after over a year of use had considered getting a new one after putting a ding in the glass but have decided against it i m done with this product if the problem gets resolved i d purchase it again in a heartbeat label unfortunate smell same as others have noted it s really too bad as the kettle looks and works great otherwise even after a vinegar washing and several kettles the smell was still quite strong label capresso sleek quick and looks great on the counter or the table i have received many compliments on it people and em just love it label poor build quality still working after years i bought this in oct and most importantly it s still working i don t have any issues with chemical odor or taste that others have referred to but there is a light accumulation of rust on the metal heating element the workmanship quality of the kettle is very low the handle was broken in the first couple of months the lid no longer is attached by the hinge and the power switch is not functioning very well any more we definitely use it a lot but i wouldn t call anything we ve done to it abuse so stars primarily based on the build quality label stopped working in months great wile it worked this unit is completely dead barely months after purchasing it not a very good record next to my regular tea kettle that i have had for years without a problem i am hoping amazon will do the right thing and replace it for me i will update once i find out whether they will label i cannot get rid of the chemical smell i have used the kettle everyday for a month i have cleaned it with soap and water repeatedly the chemical smell and taste are still present to think i bought this because i thought glass would be chemically safer than the plastic kettle i was using big mistake i m going back to my old kettle label great holy cow i m pleasantly as in exetremely pleasedwith this carafe i use it for tea my wife uses itfor coffee or whenever she needs hot water in thekitchen being able to see the water through the glassbody lets you judge the water temp and turn it offbefore it boils if you don t want water that hot i highly recommend this item because as i say mine works great label perfect perfect kettle heats up fast in about minutes and shuts off automatically so it doesn t boil over the kettle is beautiful also label it only lasted months our water kettle worked well while it worked but suddenly broke while heating the water one day the glass shattered without any trauma or impact and all the water leaked out never seen that happen to a water heater before label extraordinary water kettle we were given the model capresso water kettle for christmas the kettle is used every single day for making coffee in a drip coffee pot i was amazed at how quickly the water kettle can bring cold water to boil it is really astonishing that water can boil that fast i have read about the odor and yes we noticed the odor when we first used the kettle but that subsides with use and after only months we don t detect any odor at all the design and styling of this kettle is very well done and all around i would give it my highest recommendation label it s perfect capresso h2o plus glass water kettle polished chromethis electric kettle is perfect visually stunning and it works exactly as promised i ve used my first one for nearly a year at home and have now purchased a second one for the office easy to keep clean and attractive we use it for both tea and the french press cannot think of one single negative to report i read quite a few amazon reviews before purchasing but could not substantiate any of the negatives mentioned by a few people the only caveat is to watch for the sale price label love capresso glass water kettle this is fantastic kettle no elements to corrode quick to heat doesn t take up much room on the counter label magic pink stuff smile my daughter calls glyco-thymoline the magic pink stuff o it heals sore throats in just a few hours after gargling it is amazingly wonderful o o label an excellent guide for beginners this book provides very useful insights into planking a model ship from a kit the book is better organized than many books on model ship building but does not cover complete construction from start to finish instead pinpointing specific areas of difficulty you are likely to encounter with a variety of models and kits the book has several lists of tools and equipment for establishing beginner intermediate and advanced workspaces and also provides directions for designing several specialty tools that are quite useful the illustrations throughout are very detailed label just love it i purchased a lamp exacty like this from a local store about years ago i used it in my office a few months ago my husband decided the floor lamp in the mudroom outside his newly remodeled mancave was no longer suitable so i offered up my accord floor lampof course he accepted i have been searching all over for a second one for my officeimagine my surprise to find it on amazon i really love this lamp because it doesn t take up much space it s a perfect height next to my desk each lamp swivals and it has two levels of brightness plus it s sturdy enough to stand without toppling when the cat leaps across the room and hits it but it s light enough for me to pickup and move i m considering replacing the guest bedroom floor lamp with one of these label cut quality rivals forrest chopmaster i have had this blade installed on my bosch gcm12sd for about a month and am very happy with it my previous blade was the forrest chopmaster which is out being sharpened the chopmaster is an excellent blade but it s typically more expensive than this freud the quality of the cuts i get from this freud is essentially the same as i got from the forrest blade when it was new and sharp the sawn face of the wood is very smooth almost polished-looking and requires minimal sanding if i didn t already own the forrest blade i would order a second freud to have on hand when this one needs to be sharpened great blade at a great price label nice to see some spirituality was wonderful to see the characters depend on spirituality for a foundation in life it clearly illustrated the conflict the decisions and the conclusions the thoughts of the characters made it easier for the reader to relate to a sadly popular occurance between couples the relationship between the children and their spirituality was also evident when the idea of religon was introduced during a time of crisis all the while encouraging a family unit as well as independent growth the plot was intriguing and kept the reader guessing as to which one was the main topic definately a summer read the only way to improve this book would be to offer a little bit more history about the supporting characters although it may not contribute to the plot it would help give a more rounded picture of the group of friends this may help other use this book as an example of a support group and may provide a shimmer of guidance and hope to those in such a situation label not the best episode the world adventure teams dora with swiperthat s right as friends their mission is to save friendship day by replacing the bracelets that swiper had swiped it is really sad that on a trip around the world they didn t visit any country where spanish is spoken and what s more the plot is really boring nothing happens that is entertaining or fun for my kid the songs that swiper and dora sing together are lousy nothing about the songs is catchy or fun another odd thing is that dora s voice is different it sounds like they couldn t get the same actress they normally use to do dora s voice dora sounds older there are a lot of fun dora videos out there but this isn t one of them label nkjv study bible i placed my order january here it s february and i haven t yet receive my bible it was a gift and im still waiting on a arrival day i placed an order january here it february and i haven t receive my bible yet it been a month so im not happy at all label loved it until it failed after only weeks this air pillow provides an adjustable amount of support and was very comfortable under my back all night i used it while sleeping and loved it when i first bought it but here we are weeks later and the pillow is leaking air at an increasing rate the nozzle looks fine so maybe it leaks along a seam i m extra bummed because it is made in usa and i always expect good quality from us today i bought the optp pillow which is also made by mckenzie costs twice as much so maybe it is better made got my fingers crossed label great adjustable lumbar support this little blow up lumbar support is perfect for travel i use it in my car and on planes it blows up very easily to whatever size you want then when you re done with it it deflates completely flat so it will fit into any bag no matter how full the bag is the first one i got had a small air leak but it was replaced by the company label the best adhesive love this stuff keeps your lashes on all day and night easy application bc it gets tacky after a while easy to take off with warm water label really nice shipped fast and works well my mom is and on the shortest setting it fits her well the only thing is every couple of months the screws start coming loose so when you get it stop off at the auto parts store and ask for some lock tight just a dab on the screw and it helps keep them in place label nearly doa i have two of model re3 needed a rd for home office use ordered this new model by mistake the two re3 phones work fine but the new re3 doesn t first the phone recognizes only line one when a two line cord is plugged into the first jack to get it to work for my two lines i have to plug it into the second jack and use line and second it doesn t intercom at all with the o4re3 models this needs to go back also fwiw i like the aesthtics of the older model better sleeker looking buttons and less use of dark colors label disappointing the product performs as desired save for one huge flaw there is a coil inside that vibrates with the side of the case and circuit board using the supplied solid mounts this means you hear alot of annoying vibration the unit is not very substantial in feel unless you have your music cranked all the time or have a very noisy vehicle you will have a constant annoying rattle label gps for mariners this was a most disappointing book it was not at all helpful and basically a waste of money label excellent reference for traditional sailors execllent overview of functional and decorative marlinspike seamanship and clearly written by a real sailorman not very deep in any individual area but highly useful to the novice i actually made a few items using the instructions they worked label fantastic song too bad they messed up the cd single this is one of enigma s best songs in recent history the album version has an infectious groove that will make you want to move to it the only problem i haven t had a chance to listen to the cd single yet unfortunately the cd-single contains the copy-controlling technology that can cause problems with certain car cd players mine is one of them and if you want to listen to this cd on a computer while at work for example you are required to install some kind of player software first since i am not allowed to install software on the pcs at work i am unable to listen to this cd in the car or at my office two places that i enjoy listening to music to because of this restriction and the fact that it has prohibited me from listening to the music that i have purchased the rating is star the music may very well be star worthy but if i can t listen to it then i can t rate it label cool watch and good quality i bought this watch for it s very nice a perfect size for a woman fluorescent handles leather strap and swiss movment for this price it s pretty good i have it since about months and wear it almost everyday label don t bother if you liked her cd warm heart in a cold world which was pretty cool acoustic music with great songs that were interesting and worth hearing don t bother with this one there s nothing here but a wanna-be lisa loeb alanis m label awesome cover for my s410 camera this cover is absolutly the best for my s410 perfectly fits my s410 and protects from scratches leather is pretty thick better than i expected people may complain about no additional pockets but i dont see the necessacity for additional pockets for s410 or s500 cameras i have mb cf card which can hold over pictures and battery lasts practically forever i still had charge left in the battery after days of continues use and after taking about pictures more than with flash for the people looking for case with some additional pockets they can look at some generic cases but the bulkiness of the case defeats the whole purpose of compact camera label nice match for the camera for under this item should have come with the camera i bought my canon s230 and put it in an old spectralink phone case that really protected the camera and fit well but just didn t look great then i bought my wife the sd200 camera at and the case for the sd200 here at amazon the cases completed the cameras i am left with the more bulky older model and my wife got the sd200 but we both have an interesting set mine in black hers in red for these prices i wouldn t invest in some rd party case get the genuine canon case for your camera even if canon doesn t provide it label good sevice till now ive had good sevice from amazon com till now jan pm cst i was promised i would have my psc by today still no product when i find out whom it was coming from i will update this review to let you know where it came from so you can be cautious of them sad to be writing this review order was placed on dec i know time is allowed for the holidays but give me a break now i was told to wait till jan bull hockey i finally got my case om jan three days after my estamated delivery its what i expected from a glove fit case with no padding my canon s500 fit perfectly i like the belt loop instead of a clip like a pager because ive had pagers fall off break i see amazon desnt carry this product anymore you have to get some where else label very loose the color was acceptable however the size was not fit enough therefore the camera case will look not elegant as i thought label nice cheap phone sys perfect for a small business that doesn t need conference calling price was great works well looks very nice too very pleased label for high school graduates respectable publisher respectable series i was expecting presentation level scope and depth similar to eberly s game physics unfortunately mistake this is a book for someone who just graduated from american high school and knows only so called algebra with calculator no fractions no question there are such individuals they have to learn and for them this is pretty good book i was fooled by impressive table of contents and number of pages was useless for me lesson learned if you want eberly s quality buy eberly s books label good for laughs i love this show i was so excited when they were putting it out on dvd because i thought all i had were memories that being said i too was very disappointed in lionsgate for putting episodes in season four that were already in season three like none of us would notice i highly recommend purchasing the dvd set anyway because alf will always be great tv just don t be disappointed if you get part way into an episode and say i ve seen this already and it s not because you recently watched it on actual tv label daily serving of fruit nice chunks of dried pineapple not crazy about the sugary coating on the outside but i suppose that is to keep them from sticking together label old master a great disc robert johnson was the inspiration for generations of blues singers and blues lovers it seems a great surprise to many that he was also the inspiration for waves of british performers who covered his songs the stones cream led zep eric clapton etc etc so it s particularly interesting to listen to this disc and hear the power of the original and remastered to offer sound quality which far exceeds my old scratched records a definite buy for anyone who loves the blues label i like it i m giving this cd five stars out of five and here s why first off i like how chevelle stuck to their style with this album instead of changing it up like most bands do with their sophmore albums if anyone has listened to jimmy eat world s new album you ll know what i m talking about i also like how the sound transitions from heavy to smoothe throughout the songs some bands have trouble pulling off those types of transitions but i think chevelle did a good job of it on this album i was already a chevelle fan after their first cd and this cd does nothing to hurt that status label might as well be a single i give chevelle s new album this kind of thinking could do us in a for the good song on it vitamin r buy the single before you make a mistake of buying this album cause the other tracks on this cd are junk a out of terrible label just wasn t good having bought this book based on the review above i wanted to like this book but it was in no way a page turner i forced myself to read it and found most of it vapid and inconsequential there really is no plot so much as conveyances of saratoga scenery from one sex scene to another i found myself skipping entire chapters and not being lost in the plot because of it which says to me that much of the writing was just filler many of the characters actions and reactions to different situations just didn t ring true and then of a sudden the book just kind of ends it sounds like i m being uncommonly harsh but having just finished two historical page turners in a row my disappointment with this book grows i only give it the second star because i actually finished it label makes great popcorn very easy and fast to use i have a gas stove and have had no problem making popcorn on medium heat i have used the butter flavored oil for added flavor i look forward to taking this camping this summer label great idea but not in aluminum we love the idea of this popper and used it at least once a week for a year it worked great but when it developed a pinhole in the bottom right in the center and oil started to seep out onto the hot burner we got weary and then when it started a small fire on the burner we threw it out we ll be replacing it with a stainless steel model which means it will have to be a different brand label great popcorn popper we love it we bought this popcorn popper to use for our son s birthday party and on boy scout camp outs but have been using it at least once a week at home since we got it in august label whirly pop could be so much better we received a whirley pop as a christmas gift and love it but the construction is very cheap as a previous reviewer wrote because the pot is so thin it deforms after some use this item would get a if the pot were made of better materials if the lid would clip on and off a bit easier a shame since the popcorn is so good label broke after first use the first time i was making popcorn the plastic gear on the top completely shredded when turning the handle to keep from burning-yeah it burnt couldn t turn and threw away the popcorn and the popper should ve lasted longer it would ve been a nice popper label shoddy and unsafe i bought poppers one for myself and one for a gift i used mine about times and noticed that one of the little wooden knobs had fallen off i searched for minutes and found one sharp screw pin in my popcorn i never found the other pin so maybe we ate it i sent both back as i dont want my granddaughter to swallow a metal pin i was so dissappointed since now i have to come up with another gift at the last minute label biased reviews i was interested in purchasing this popcorn maker as part of a gift set however when reading the reviews on amazon com i realized a serious problem the reviews are biased look through the reviews you ll see the majority of the reviews give the product a full stars which is extremely surprising considering most reviewers are finicky are written in the same tone style of writing and say what a wonderful gift this would make many also mention that it s the best popcorn ever and they ve used it for several years some even venture to say it only works well only if you use wabash popcorn if you read reviews less than stars you ll see all writers say this gadget broke melted within a couple months there is a serious bias in these reviews and i hope consumers are not being taken advantage of some of the high reviews may be valid but i m quite certain nearly all are false i ve decided not to purchase the item label construction could be a lot better the whirley-pop model we bought is different from the one shownthe gears are plasticbad idea and the handle is plastic and set very close to the pot bad idea the lid stayed on for the first uses then just failed it s almost impossible to handle piping-hot oil and attempt to keep the lid on i consider it a definite hazard the handle on our model is built so that one s hand is directly over the stove burner add attempts at controlling the entire contraption with oven mitts and you have a recipe for disaster i m too afraid to wrestle with it againi m afraid i ll burn myself which is a shame because the popper really makes excellent popcorn i d buy another one if it were better-constructed and had metal gears label don t buy this piece of it was a great idea it s a shame a good company didn t make it can t even blame it on foreigners this piece of crap is a rip off i did t know you could make a pot out of tin foil calling it flimsy would be a compliment as soon as you assemble it and turn the handle once to see how it works you ve made a dimple in the bottom of the pot and best of all you can press it back into shape with your fingernail and no effort the plastic gearing for the turning handle might last or uses the only thing that was well made was the wooden handle i guess they were out of balsa wood that day don t buy this save your money for good popcorn at the theatre label way better than microwave popcorn the whirleypop makes great tasting popcorn really quickly it s not much more trouble than microwave popcorn in about the same amount of time and the results are far superior to microwave it s also a lot of fun to use label not sturdy enough the plastic gears on these poppers do not grip to the metal post crank and slip any resistance results in the user turning the handle but no movement within the popper worked great for first year of average or less use but now pretty intermittant and a really more pain than worth i only continue to use it to keep oil buildup off of other pans we shake not crank now won t buy another as it s unfortunately yet another disposable product that overloads landfills label even works will cooking spray toasts other items inca corn i really love this thing someone was giving one away and i was surprised to see it on amazon i love mine i actually gave away my microwave popcorn popper because i ave this i feel better eating something not microwaved and it is just as fast i toasted that inca corn with it it came out great much lower in calories than if i fried it like the packet said i dont even pour oil i just use oil spray try a misto that would be best when you pop with no oil just spray a little oil spray on the popcorn afterward to make salt stick label good eatin i love this popper it is a fun and easy way to have a healthy and delicious snack i purchased it two years ago and have eaten microwave popcorn only once since then yuck once you prepare your popcorn with the whirley-popper you will not want another bag of nuked popcorn ever again label something is wrong here i agree with a previous reviewsomething about the accolades is biased here consider the repeating phrases this does not produce great popcorn i bought the unit with the special wabash popcorn pouches touted to have won awards i have used several and the popcorn is not crisp but is chewy not particularly special in flavor and full of saturated fat because of the coconut oil blend in the pouches the unit is flimsy prone to bending and imo does not produce popcorn as good as popsecret homestyle or orville s movie theater microwave popcorn avoid this item within weeks i had to dispose of it label best popcorn this makes the best popcorn i ve had and with only a teaspoon or so of oil i have used mine for about years but i think it is time for it to be replaced it only has one small dent and a nice patina on the inside but the gears are finally giving out i have a new one that i had bought for gift-giving purposes but i think it will be staying with me while the old one is retired i have more than gotten mine money s worth although now i am spoiled and won t eat microwave popcorn any more label whirlypop popper is kinda cheezy inexpensive but imo pretty poorly constructed the idea is good pop all the kernels and it does that but it is poorly put together with barely marginal parts that slip and so ultimately we just tossed it and went back to the old pot cannot recommend to buy label whirley-pop stovetop popcorn popper product works fine although it looks fragile pay attention to instructions use med-high heat for popping and turn crank slowly great with white pop corn as well as yellow easy clean up would not recommend theater type popcorn initially supplieds label whirley pop we love this popcorn cooks real nice and fluffy in this pan easy to use hand crank is easy to use and located in a easy to reach place label not impressed this takes up too much cabinet space for it s usefulness i much prefer my hotair popper it is awkward to hold on to and if you use some of their crazy recipes that include sugar or other sticky ingredients it is a pain to clean i really do not care for this item label gear mechanism broke after about uses this popper made terrific tasting popcorn but the turning gearmechanism on the top of the pan is made of plastic and broke afteri used the pan about times the pan heats up very hot and theplatic is a poor choice to use in the turning mechanism they should of used metal label remind me of my childhood i gave this to my year old grandmother for a gift because she can not use the microwave due to a pacemaker she loved it and is always making popcorn now the popcorn that came with it was the best popcorn we ever tasted the only problem she has is that it is hard to use when she is having problems with her hands she says i love it no matter if my hand hurts lol label best popcorn popper ever i have used several poppers auto air etc this is the best yes you have to stand over it for to minutes but it pops almost every kernel i have used the cheapest corn and the best-same results you have to follow the instructions otherwise you will writing a negative review it works as designed i would buy this again or as a gift for anybody label great product this is the one i had originally for over a year till it fell off the top of the fridge and the lid broke very sad for us because we love popcorn i tried a different version of a different brand from fleet farm and that one was terrible whirley-pop is the way to go label electric blue i m a huge fan of sfx it goes on well and has staying power the colors stay bright after repeated washing and they don t bleed on to everything love this shade for a bright blue label study-worthy i found this in an effort to lead a women s study on women in ministry i had dug long and hard to find a concise review of various impacting christian-women s tales all in one place it is hard to find christian women biographies esp of living women i appreciate the author s research and that she narrowed to women when she interviewed many more each chapter is a very brief overview of each woman but it shows us christian women who are all over world and most are still alive in our study we ve noticed how powerfully god uses women in many different ways in all countries each woman in book seems to start small ask god for guidance then he helps them see more of his big vision and we see how they act on it not amazingly written and each bio may bring up more questions than it answers but it s a start for world-perspective on being a christian\n"

      "label missing over pages i have found that the entire n section and a good deal of the m section have not been included in this book due to an obvious misprint beware buyer label movie guide the book is comprehensive very seldom you try to look up a picture or video which is not in the book the reviews are sometimes too short however the book would be too unhandy if every picture had a bigger review also the facts about the different movies are accurate and helpful label great collection johnson records stars were the dubs and the shells but the other groups althoughnot as well known also give a good accounting of themselves label good album continuing the hits this is another good album from switchfoot unfortunately in the omaha area the song oh gravity has not been played on the stations i listen to so this album snuck up on me for release its good but i honestly like the last album nothing is sound a bit more a little more rock edge this album is solid but nothing that seems groundbreaking for them although it is a good continuation of their sound much more of a poppy feel in my book i don t here the big air play singles on this album like dare you to move meant to live or stars still a great album to get available at a major electric discount stores with bonus tracks and a bonus download label great gaming and working accesorie you will newer get wrong with it the movement is very smooth and it has two sides for diffent tipe of people you have to use each side to find out which one is more comfortable for you i recommend this mouse pad for every one label wake up amazon we need a correction people do not buy this album until the error on this itemhas been corrected the album does not match the description even as an import it should not cost i really lovethe artist but this is hurting her album sales i hope this willbe corrected soon i would like to see what tracks are actually on the import label a unique book for any gardener or nature-lover clare leighton s woodcuts are exquisite alone but her writing is simple and elegant enough to quietly intensify their impact i enjoyed the book so much i m ordering more one for a british friend who can especially enjoy the references to native birds and flowers and another for my elderly mother who will enjoy memories of being a child who spent time in her family s garden during the the time leighton chronicles so well label great read this is an excellent book it was recommended to me by a friend and worth every penny extremely motivating i have two other books in the series that i enjoy just as much label a wonderful book to help you walk closer with god i got the audiobook from the library and after i returned it i missed it so much that i went out and bought the book i carry it in my purse so that i have it if i need it it is a wonderful book to read in any time weather you are already prayerful and feeling close to god or when you feel like you are falling away from god and you don t know how to find him i recomend this book to any woman label not great but entertaining mammoth reminded me a little too much of timeline and jurassic park in places but it was an enjoyable read nevertheless perfect for a rainy day label crap firstly the buttons seem to protrude too much cauing them to be depressed unintentionally after about a week a couple of the buttons seemed to jam up a week later the display turned off completely all this after only weeks of wear this watch is a poorly designed piece of crap label earth in james powell book about the evolution of earth and the dating techniques was interesting to read about it is amazing how much we can find out about earth just by studing certain things or by looking into space label at cents per movie you re getting your money s worth honestly the title and packaging are misleading this is a pile of crap but it s four-star crap seriously while the general movie viewer will be disappointed in this collection anyone with an interest in typical movies of the period will be delighted to get so much for so little label not my idea of classic unless classic just means old i do love old movies and when i had tv i watched a lot of old movies i also love musicals but i was sorely disappointed with this collection there are discs of movies in the package and of all the so-called classics i had only heard of or previously seen of them i suppose this is not a terribly bad value for the price but i already have royal wedding on another disc featuring fred astaire and i wouldn t have purchased this set just to get the dorsey brothers film i think this set would be a good buy for students of black history in the arts label pj toronto i was at this show and i think it was top quality thanks to the participation of the crowd during wishlist the entire arena put their arms up during the line million arms upraised which seemed to both surprise and thrill eddie i think you can hear him kind of chuckle right after the line additionally the crowd participation turned baba o riley from an appreciated cover into a real event this cd really captures an imperfect yet perfect show from one of the world s top live bands label im chanting nooooooo i was really put off by the chanting i guess mostly because the cover of the box did not tell me this was a chanting yoga video i also found the instructor s approach to be distracting and annoying but mostly it was the chanting label the voice the session has its points namely the explanation of the poses as some of the other reviewers have stated but i cannot get past her annoying grating voice i have not been able to actually complete a workout not because of the difficulty of the poses but because of that voice monotone doesn t begin do justice i must admit i m somewhat sensitive to this issue being a professional singer and voice teacher however the number of other reviewers who mentioned this distraction leads me to believe that this is something that ms doane should adjust in future tapings again her interview voice was perfectly pleasant this was my first purchase of a nicki doane yoga video it would take a notice that she has revamped her instructional delivery and at least an audio preview to entice me to purchase another label only for someone who has never done astanga what a letdown i have done a lot of astanga but bought the beginners dvd because i am not terribly flexible and have had some injuries according to the box it s a hour minute program which would be a normal time to get through the entire astanga first series poses but in reality only minutes of this dvd is poses and she only gets through some of the standing poses at a glacial pace i felt like i d barely gotten warmed up and she was laying down for sivasana i do not recommend this dvd unless you have literally never done an astanga series label do not buy this toaster amazon do not sell this product to another customer beware this toaster is unsafe i purchased this product on september and on december it almost caught my kitchen on fire the left slots will not eject the toast also the special eject push button does not work had i not been in the kitchen the bread would have caught fire the bread ended up being so charred it was worthless so much for assuming the toaster works properly i have tried contacting t-fal via the telephone and email t-fal sent me an email with incident but to date no one has contacted me back the wait-time on the phone is ridiculous t-fal should have more respect for consumers so now i m expected to ship the product to a t-fal service center and pay for shipping on a product that didn t even last months please amazon remove this product from your store and do not sell it to anyone else model ref tt750150 ya label great toaster if you want black or undertoasted bread we bought the toaster because we liked the look and because there was an overall favorable view of it here once we got it home we discovered it was great at toasting the bread to blackness or not really toasted at all we went through an entire loaf of bread to find the right spot to place the dial and we found that it went from one click made it not toasted at all not enough to make it more stiff than a regular piece of bread or blackened to inedibility if we went to the next setting from that on top of the problem with it not working it takes up waaaaaaay too much space on the counter and the mechanism it uses to hold the bread in the toaster often keeps the bread from going down all the way bottom line we bought a toaster that is too big and requires us to sit and watch the bread and pop it up manually or we get a burned piece of bread not effective on any level label behemoth toasterbe prepared no doubt you have read all the technical reviews actual use is that it is a very fast hot toaster you will be pleased with the time it takes to toast anything however it toasts unevenly the initial pictures appeared that it is a unique design but manageable size but the pink elephant is that it is huge and appears to overtake all other appliances in the kitchen you may have nightmares of this gargantuan slicer it scares me every time i go into the kitchen i feel like i have entered into the twilight zone label not made in the usa my husband and i bought this toaster because it was advertised as being made in the usa it arrived today and is clearly marked in several places that it is made in china i will be returning it tomorrow label what a cool toaster i ve never had a toaster before but i ve had plenty of toaster-ovens after we accidentally torched our last toaster-oven by keeping taco shells in it too long we tried a cheap toaster-oven which actually failed to toast and here i was thinking toaster-oven technology is so simple and well-known they wouldn t be able to screw it up so my wife convinced me to try a toaster and we got this on seeing as it s somewhat mid-priced no more budget appliances for me and it has several cool features the high-lift lever and the bagel setting as previous reviewers note toasting a bagel on only one side makes all the difference and of course it just looks cool we re hipper now that we own it and get invited to a lot more parties i don t have anything bad to say about it label not pleased i have returned the item as it did not work properly toast was done unevenly and settings did not work at all sometimes a lower setting would result in dark toast and a higher one with too light toast considering the price it was quite a disappointment label looks great works not so much great looking toaster unfortunately i had the same uneven toasting problem that many other people mention then it stopped working about a year later really not worth it label toaster this is a gift i love it and i think that it will fit in the kitchen just fine and i know the person i bought it for will love it label fine while it lasted when i first received this toaster it worked just fine although it is very large and takes up a lot of counter space within weeks though of the slots stopped working the lever wouldn t stay down so we couldn t use that side at all when i contacted t-fal about the problem they said i could pay to ship the toaster to a little repair shop and it might be repaired i chose not to do that because shipping that giant toaster would cost about as much as buying a new toaster at wal-mart and i would have no toaster at all for an undetermined amount of time while they attempted to fix it i kept it and used it as the world s largest slot toaster for more months until the remaining slots also stopped working again t-fal told me that i could pay to ship the toaster to a repair shop paying for a toaster is not a good deal when it doesn t even last months label floor toast length minsi know it s funny the first time you find your toast on the floor this only happens in the left slot as far as i have noticed will keep you posted label abolutely brilliant one of the best books i ve read in many a year fast-paced and full of action yet written with a subtle plot which keeps you guessing all the way through the book a must buy for any forgotten realms fan label it s awful so i get this in an effort to help my husband sleep while i watch tv late at night on the second day the foam ear cover popped off never to be replaced although i did try and i m usually good at this kind of thing inside the foam ear cover the plastic knob has a sharp little nipple on it so to put that side in my ear i had to get a fingernail file and file down the protrusion now i have a foam cover on one side and the plastic ear piece on the other ok at least the sound works and then suddenly a month later it didn t work it s charged it is connected right because it used to work but now all i get is static and a faint sound of what is on tv i have to try and hear what they are saying through the white noise surrounding the sound oh and try and read their lips as i watch the program it s so much trouble and i spent so much money i ll just try and sleep label urlfieldtrash product works great when it s not broken have gone through two in the last two years first one had an electronic issue the second broke in half product needs to be improved before i buy another one label we both love them thank you tv ears my husband needed the sound up on the tv to be able to hear every word some friends had gotten the tv ears and liked them so much they had purchased a second set that was good enough for me to get them for my husband for christmas at first he wasn t sure as he had tried another type but after giving them a chance he really likes them and i am happy for the both of us and a big plus was that amazon was the least expensive as they usually are label think twice i purchased this item for my father-in-law for a holdiday gift he loved them then months later the headset broke i contacted tv ears and paid over for a replacement headset again my father-in-law was happy lo and behold the headset broke again i contacted tv ears and again was told something to get a replacement warranty is days i know a year old man isn t like a year old so i can t blame him for them breaking twice don t buy this item unless you are willing to replace headsets at least twice a year label my new set of ears the tv ears work just great i no longer annoy my wife with high volume the only reason it didn t give it stars was because the ear pads are very hard on the ears and starts to hurt after the first half hour wish they provided a little more padding label nice concept poor execution good idea for people who want to watch tv while their partner sleeps unfortunatel very poor design earpieces too tight also the foam around the plastic part of the earpieces is way too thin to protect the ears from the hard plastic hurts your ears after just a few minutes and the center part that dangles is too heavy and makes the earpieces fall out of your ears label tv ears after receiving the order found it would not work on my tv without buying some additional kit i did not wish to do this so am returning it and don t know if it works or not label arguably their best i know alot of pixies fans will disagree but i think trompe le monde is their best don t get me wrong all of their albums are excellent even bossanova which is the cd that gets bummed on the most pretty unfairly if you consider some of the other cds that came out in doolittle and trompe are a pretty close race but i have to choose trompe just slightly the thing i love about it is the variety it shows all of the pixies moods to great effect punk planet of sound u-mass pop navajo know motorway spacey bird dream distance rate and of course the fucked-upness that we all love about the pixies subbacultcha label the best pixies album ever this is a great album it s too bad they broke up and nothing that frank black has done since even comes close label one of my all time favorite stories cold light is one of the best stories i ve ever read i ve been looking for years to get another copy of this book simply to read that story again while the other two stories in the book are very good it is cold light which makes this a book to keep in your collection label dude you re getting a del l once listened to mistadaobolina on repeat for almost an hour and it just got better and better the rest of the album is so-so but mistadabolina is del s stairway to heaven label worst most overpriced curling iron ever do not purchase it breaks after months and the company does not honor its warranty label full zipper hose cover cover did fall short about for my brand new hose with shut off for low volt central vac i received a dark blue cover it is fine i would prefer a choice in color otherwise i think the hose cover will be great in keeping the hose from damaging my floors walls and furniture the price was great at under and the shipment came in time though i was not under the gun to get it delivered label unreliable batteries don t buy or use ultralast aa batteries can be used until you hit a bad one it ll fizz and pop and pour acid all over the inside of your device possibly destroying your device be careful to wash the liquid off your hands immediately or it can burn through your skin and clothes if a battery cannot be reliable of the time then its worthless throw all your ultralast batteries away and never purchase them again stick to well known brandnames ultrafast are cheap for a reason you get what you pay for they leak and it s unpredictable as to which batteries will leak and when i will not use ever again use a different brand label substitue for higher priced battery good for use in products which are not used daily a lower cost alternative to more expensive batteries make sure you examine closely for leakage label disney s musketeers growing up with disney my husband and i were dissapointed in this video instead of taking the classic humor of things like falling tripping being knocked on the head with an anvel this video uses degrading language as it s humor by this i mean the character s would call each other names like stupid and cut down on one another we bought this for our year old and didn t think we d have to review it before he watched it because it s disney we ended up having to skip through sections we didn t think age appropriate we didn t even finish watching the video i would say the minimum age for this video is yo we will be reviewing all disney videos before we let our children watch them from now on label a change of venue for baldacci i m a big fan of his political thrillers this book delivered a welcome change of venue and much better than his true blue attempt to shift gears label the best book i ve read this summer the winner has it all fast paced keeps you wondering what the next page will bring just the right amount of intrigue surprise action realistic characters romance this was my first baldacci novel it won t be my last can t wait to read another label best suspense thriller novel ever i read david baldacci s books total control and absolute power which were terrific well written and very suspenseful i have never read a book as fantastic as the winner it is the very best book i have ever read of any category i couldn t put it down i referred it to several friends who read it overnite i cannot properly describe this book to give it the justice it deserves the story is far fetched but at the same time the way baldacci writes it seems and very possibly could be extremely real i recommend that everyone read this book in fact i wish i could read it then forget what it was about so i could read it over and over again label the winner this is a great story and a page turner for me i am always a fan of baldecci good clean read as always label the winner not the first books were the the winners not this un-edited overly long manuscript please mr baldacci don t catch stephen kingitis do not waste your time label mostly boring and downright stupid a very long repetitous and insipid offering mostly unbelieveable bordering on outright silly i wouldn t recommend this for anyone label on the edge i was on the edge almost the entire time i was reading it don t want to give the plot away but i wanted well can t tell you what i wanted good read and exteremely detailed worth every penny label good book i really enjoyed this book better than other baldacci books i have read makes you wonder can the lottery be fixed lou ann deserved the money i wish i knew the secret to being as fit as she wass to beat up on so many men good girl label too much stupidity first the idea of a fixed result it s just an impossible thing to happen second the trilling effects were mainly caused by stupidities of luann tyler herself this makes reader feels to be fooled by the author label boring almost stupid wow it s hard to believe this book was written by the same author who wrote the sixth man the winner is so boring no action don t care about any of the characters it s almost stupid in parts i hate not finishing books i paid for so finished it despite the fact it was painful to read label baldacci s worst spoiler this is baldacci s worst i could never get over the fact that this woman got tired of living in europe and new zealand and why did she think she had to keep on the run in europe but could come home to the us where she was wanted for murder and settle down the premise was just plain stupid please keep in mind that i love baldacci s other books if this woman had stayed away many innocent people would not have died yeah because of her they caught the bad guy but he had stopped rigging the lottery and killing people long ago was catching him really worth more people getting killed how ironic that after getting these people killed she still got to keep million tax-free label the book is a winner this is a great story because it allows you to think about what you would do in luann taylor s main character situation the question is does she want to win the lottery she is approached by a strange man who says he can make this happen she is dirt poor and does not know what to do this could be her only shot to do something with her life and she can t let it pass her by a great read for entertainment and an interesting look at the lottery industry baldacci keeps you turning the page until the end label a real let-down compared to other baldacci books after reading his first two novels i could not wait to tear into the winner what a disappointment where his others were fresh invigorating and intricately plotted this one was trite predictable and utterly absurd the characters were so one-dimensional it was embarrassing and the scenarios he had them in were typical cookie-cutter thriller plots i have a hard time believing the same author wrote absolute power and total control two books which i thought were brilliant label getting out of the trailer is a killer oh luann get out while you can this book is a great read and sports an interesting storyline i would strongly recommend this one if you have a few evenings to kill label great villain unlike a few of the other david baldacci books i ve read the winner was very fun to read the characters still haven t changed a gorgeous woman and an ex-fbi-undercover-agent but baldacci has managed to make them fun again it s entirely possible that this is because of the villain in this book the story isn t really as interesting although various bits surprised me as absolute power or the simple truth but the villain was great the villain jackson is a power-hungry psycho intent on garnering lots of power and outsmarting everyone jackson is easily the best part of this book i think the story is interesting enough although most of the book was like what will jackson do next for me and the chapters centering on him were easily the best the winner is worth reading if only because of jackson label the winner by david baldacci wow what a thrill ride this book was i couln t put it down it is so well written and fun to read from the very first chapter baldacci is an amazing story teller label very disappointing based on the previews and the excellent billed cast i was expecting a smart and intelligent movie instead i got a terribly self-indulgent cliched mess of a movie that is mostly the writer-director-star nattering on she must have extreme narcissism to cast herself to play what i presume was supposed to be a charming and brilliant love interest but the whole relationship was just creepy and weird with a large age gap and no chemistry adam scott did his best but the rest of the great cast was utterly wasted and were clearly there as a favor for this rejected film-school project perhaps my high expectations are leading to an overly negative reaction to this film but either way it was terrible and i wouldn t recommend it to anyone label such a great cast such terrible writing and direction the premise was a good one but the execution left me wondering how you could come up with so less than the sum of the parts label don t waste your time or money dont waste your time i couldn t even finish it not funny at all boring as can be doesnt even deserve one star label horse manure within two minutes of this crass vulgar so-called comedy one of the supposedly charming male leads tells a female friend over the phone that she needs to get the cobwebs out of her vagina less than minutes in he s telling her men worry about their partners having a baby because they fret the mother s vaginas will become cavernous and therefore she won t be attractive and click went the off button i ve seen my wife struggle at times to deal with almost casual sexism that can damage a career i watch with alarm as my teenage daughter navigates a modern culture where some players seem to delight in putting down women and friends with kids is just continuing that trend shame on everyone involved in this pile of ordure label did not enjoy i was very disappointed by this movie this movie promised to be thoughtful and witty with a cast including jon hamm and kristen wiig i thought the premise of kids changing a group of friends and the couples themselves would be interesting and relatable the characters proved to be unable to evoke much sympathy from me as they wallowed in their disappointments with life i found the movie depressing and un-insightful label think when harry met sally had a baby i never write reviews but i felt the need to defend this one because it s really really good jennifer westfeldt is wonderful adam scott too the supporting cast manages to pull off rich dimensional characters with little screen time because all characters are well-drawn and well-cast think when harry met sally there is no fake orgasm scene but you do drop in and out of these people s lives as they inch closer toward each other and further away toward the end i half expected billy crystal to show up and say i came here tonight because when you realize that you want to spend the rest of your life with someone you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible it might not be what people are used to in terms of a romantic comedy or what passes for one today instead it s engaging and true-to-life i smiled more than i laughed but i smiled a lot label after a year it loses value i ve had this flashlight for over a year the concept was great until time passed and it needed more vigorous shaking just to shine for seconds or less we kept this flashlight in the car for emergencies however it s a pretty long flashlight and we ve found smaller flashlights on amazon that are crank based and therefore take far less effort and shine brighter for a similar price you can find these crank flashlights that nowadays use leds and offer cell phone-charging capabilities as well as a built-in radio label it works it is not a lighthouse but something that saves the situation don t think that you can illuminate your entire house with it but it really keeps giving light for hours with a little amount of decrease in intensity so the description meets the fact label part fun part romantic part nostalgic a nice mix a friend lent me the cd to listen to several years ago i really enjoyed the fast songs but one song more than the stars really caught my ear so much so in fact that it was the song that my wife and i requested for our first dance at our wedding reception it was nice label there need to be some consistent rules in any game it s interesting to see the different reactions to the book i read it first knowing nothing about it and not looking at reviews though i did enjoy reading it i leaned towards those who found it confusing my biggest problem was the arbitrariness of the universe we were put in the rules changed every few paragraphs so i found that it all became rather arbitrary after a while i cared less about what was going to happen and certainly gave up trying to make any sense out of it in the end they somehow got rid of the prophet but i really have no idea how or why it worked label ok can not use it is bigger than my cabinet i have to see about return it back or find onother use for it label dope ass rims i got both the front and back rims for my cruiser as well as the white-wall tires they both were just as shown in the picture chrome plated and they come with everything you need to put them on your bike make sure to have an old coaster break to see how to assemble the one on the back rim because it can be a little tricky overall these rims are awesome i put the white-wall tires on also from the same seller and they are dope label wonderful pocket reference not quite pocketsized though simple and sweet good refence easy lookup structure fast answers anyone dealing with css should have this close by label cute but very diappointing i am using the itrip made for the old model of ipod i have found it very difficult to get good sounding music on this thing i am used to using the irock a battery version with only stations for long drives it works much more reliably and the sound quality has been excellent even when the itrip works the sound is often distorted at normal volume noises from base and unclear sounding when i drive really far from even a small metropolitan area the sound clears up but i have much better reception with the irock label itrip looks sounds this device is cute and is engineered perfectly for the ipod the sound quality i got was marginal at best it depends on being able to find an unused frequency that is quiet i found that a good frequency on one side of town would be noisy on the other side of town and i was always changing channels trying to get and keep a good station high marks for ergonomics size and for the ability to generate ohs and ahhs the underlying fm technology is problamatic the power it s allowed to use for broadcast is weak and any strong fm station on a nearby band will overwhelm it i found the same problem with the transpod a competiing product which used an analog tuner instead of a digital tuner the transpod was subject to drift but you could for or minutes get pretty good sound by having a light touch on the dial my recommendation a cassette adapator label very frustrating to use this has to be about the most frustrating piece of hardware i ve purchased recently in two of my vehicles it doesn t work most of the time and in another vehicle it works for minutes before a radio station cuts in if i m lucky i used the itrip in san francisco oakland and san jose with equal frustration in my opinion it is not worth its high price or any price you won t want to show off your ipod while using this device very disappointing label not worth it i bought this hoping to use the itrip in the car but the signal is terrible it s so fuzzy its not even worth listening to if you have a stereo at home and you place the itrip within a few inches of it this is the only time the itrip does anything also having the itrip stations mixed in with songs is annoying label who designed this thing this has the worst interface look elsewhere it is tightly integrated with the ipod but in a horrible horrible way look for one that you can set the station external to the ipod and it stays if you are driving and tryign to use this you will probably crash i am not joking this is one of the worst designed products i have ever seen label won t work in a city dont but this product maybe if you live in the middle of nowhere it will work but you have to find a fm frequency that is perfectly silent for it to work and even then the quality isn t very good in nyc or boston there are no stations that work well at all i got this and thought it was awesome for about minutes and then got extremely frustrated as the music sounds horrible on every station around here label this is crap the luggage handle was broken after days later i purchase it looks useful but i think the maker do not consider how it get weight inside of bag was just cheap ass plastic i mean it is going to be very easily broken you cannot put stuff or tools like picture i literally waste my label brenda and cheese this work represents deep textual layering that shouldn t intimidate with its elevated tone sentences are highly structured and extremely literate with references to women s rights struggles soviet nationalism and yes even good old-fashioned romance these poems don t require patience so much as deserve repeated visits like a fine cheddar the work accrues in value as it ages simply devine label great item the toro blower vac is great the power is just right for either blowing leaves and grass or vacuuming a high quality product label toro leaf vac awkward at best i bought this toro leaf blower to replace a black decker one that the motor quit working after years of light duty all the reviews weregreat on this toro metal impeller instead of plastic and how powerfull this one was etc etc i found this toro to be awkward to hold no real balance to it with the bag the cord was coming out the front which i kept tripping on and coming unplugged i found the dial up variable speed power switch to be annoying as well i liked the black and decker speed select switch better as far as suction power again i thought it had less than the b d if i had to do over i would take a pass on the toro label leaf blower toro ultra amp electric blower vacuum bought for my son and he loves it it works great and is a lot stronger than others just like the advertisers said if you want to make the greatest leaf piles in the world for your kids and want to do it in half the time this is the tool for you label toro blower vac i received the product in very good condition very fast deli have not had a chance to use it yet because it is still winter but going by the reviews is should be fine label toro ultra electric blower vacuum this is a very powerful yet light tool that is easy for a woman to use i like how it mulches the leaves and reduces the need to use lots of yard bags label kay h hill from rocky mount nc this was shipped from amazon and arrived on time i love it i can vacuum around the pool and the flower beds the blower it great also i like buying from amazon label blower died after one minute use i used the unit on my asphalt driveway to blow away a light sprinkling of leaves and pine needles it worked great only had to use it for less than minutes it was so fast i pulled it out the next day for the same purpose the blower would not power up i tried different extension cords and outlets nothing worked the motor or electrical died just a bad unit i guess i am exchanging for replacement will update review later label great mulcher most leaf vac blowers have a plastic impeller if you are looking for a good vac that mulches the leaves this is a good investment the impeller on this tool is metal with mulching heads integrated into the impeller other vacs that i owned with plastic impellers did a poor job of mulching and the impeller would break if you sucked up stones or even acorns good value and works great label toro ultra amp electric blower vac model51599 toro ultra amp variable speed electric blower vacuum with metal impeller i purchased this item on received it in a reasonable time frame and item was in excellent condition my experience using the toro blower vac took a short time getting familiar with and balance control the toro does its gob well in vacuuming leaves i recommend low setting for light leaves and max setting for heavy leaves such as oak leaves relatively quiet and thick plastic housing so it will take a lot of abuse but i do recommend to the manufacture that their zipper bag on reverse side have a more uniform zipper seam becouse leaf particles cling to zipper seam and could cause problems opening and closing thankyou amazon label do not buy won t last mine died after years take my advice don t buy one of these because it won t last after three years of very very light use the motor bearings went out and would only operate at a fraction of the speed than when new i never used the vacuum so i know it wasn t from sucking up something that would ve harmed the bearings they don t even sale a replacement motor i replaced a craftsman that lasted years with this piece of crap made in mexico if that gives you a hint buy a good crasftman that s what i m going to do label works great this blower vac was all i expected it would be the control which lets you dial the speed i found very useful the lower speed gives much better control i was able to clean my garage without blowing everything away as a leaf vac multcher it worked great the only problem i had was that the bag got too heavy for me oh well i am a yr old woman i found that i could rest the bag on the ground just move the bag a bit at a time where the leaves were deeply layered where they were scattered i switched to the blower and piled them up i chose this torotoro ultra amp variable-speed electric blower vacuum with metal impellerbecause it has the metal impeller i am very satisfied with this purchase label excellent blower at a good price i was looking for a strong blower that was also relatively quiet this electric model from toro met both requirements i have used the blower several times and have not been disappointed while most of the reviews for this product are very positive several mention the motor burning out after a short time it is very important to follow the extension cord ratings for both gauge and length when using this product if you use a light duty extension cord or exceed the length recommendations you are going to burn out the motor label good but could be better my previous toro had a plastic impeller so when it no longer worked the electrical connection pulled out i shopped around but still came to the conclusion that the was still one of the best ones on the market the old one worked quite well so i thought i ll try another one i like the fact that it has more than speeds although the top speed doesn t seem to be as fast at my previous speed model i think this is a good product except that a convenience in my previous model to wrap the extension cord around to keep it connected is missing on the all of my electrical outdoor gear have this item built into their devices so i m really curious as to why toro decided not to place it on the it would make this model even better as far a performance it is loud but very effective if this one dies i can only hope toro reads these reviews and will install a device to wrap the cord around to keep everything connected label out of balance my previous toro was the same model and lasted four years until the motor gave out i would have given it stars i purchased a new one and immediately noticed this one had a vibration and more noise even at low speeds i returned it for another of the same model and this one is better but still not as smooth and quiet as the old one was i will be returning this one and looking for another brand label leaf vac blower i like the blower attachment on the front but the vacuum tube is straight down which requires you to get into your pile of leaves to vacuum i like the variable speed control label junk blower worked fine under very light duty leaf blowing only no mulching for exactly one year and then burned out sounded like a battery operated tool slowing down over about minutes until it totally stopped i expected way more from a product with the name toro on it just more foreign made crap label good machine but poor quality bag this performs quite well however if you suck up certain items such as small pebbles or sticks twigs etc they can blow through the bag the zipper side is what fails there seems to be some design flaw weakness so i would buy a backup bag or two if you can find one i use it for cleaning my garage driveway sidewalk and it does a very good job plenty of suction label plenty of blow power toro ultra amp variable speed electric blower vacuum with metal impeller this must be one of the most powerful electric blowers around and if you ever want to pick up and grind leaves it does a good job of that with the metal impeller i did find the suction tube to be too small for large magnolia leaves but it works well with anything smaller i found it a bit difficult to manage with the bag slung over your shoulder it is a bit heavier than my previous blower and the handle configuration also made it more difficult to handle but then perhaps with more use i ll get the hang of it for blowing power however it can t be beat and best of all it is much quieter than its gas powered brothers which i find to be soooo annoying when the neighbors crank them up in the morning label fantastic i tried out two quite expensive gas blowers before giving up and getting this one it s not even close this thing blows them away quite literally i was able to accomplish twice the cleanup with half the effort of the gas blowers do not hesitate to buy this thing you ll be relieved to have such a useful fall cleanup tool label happy buyer i am very impressed with the toro blower vacuum the blower is very powerful and is adjustable the vacuum is also very impressive the only down side so far has to be the cord we have a huge yard and the cord only reaches so far i suppose i can solve that by buying a longer cord also the vacuum is a bit time consuming versus just picking up the leaves by hand you do save a lot of time by blowing the leaves in to a pile instead of having to rake them though overall we are extremely happy label toro amp electric blower the first time the blower was used it lasted for less than a minute and smoke started coming out of the engine i returned the product to an authorized repair center and still have not received the unit back it has been almost weeks since it was dropped off now it is snowing so it doesn t do me any good label over rated this blower vacumn is over rated it is heavy and cumbersome to handle does not do a good job of vacumning up leaves don t waste your money label very pleased my toro just arrived today sooner than expected yay and for the last hours it s been cleaning up part of the yard where i can t effectivly mow the leaves i am surrounded by old trees and have a huge yard so this machine will have plenty to do i was very impressed with its power and effectiveness the leaves were dry but not all were withered yet i used it as a blower to create some big piles to make sure there weren t any large twigs in the mess when it did suck up ones that i was a little concerned about it never faltered i got braver and vacuumed an ivy bed without pre-inspecting it it encountered some old damp leaves under the newer ones and handled all the material including twigs very well switching from blower to vacuum is easy the bag holds just enough to not be unmanageable for me i like that it is quieter than my other old blower and the vacuum feature with metal impeller makes it a real winner label great but gets you dirty the toro was bought for me to use in cleaning up my rose beds i used it and it had good vacuum pressure and did a good job the only thing was it filtered dirt all over you label three in a row broke down i ve had three toro variable-speed electric blower vacuums in the space of five years the first one broke down just plain stopped working about two weeks after i bought it i took it back to the store and they exchanged it for a new one the second one worked fine until just two months after the two-year guarantee ran out i really liked the way the machine handles and how efficiently it blows leaves a big deal here in new england so i bought another one that one managed to keep running eight months after the guarantee ran out when it too broke down today i m going to see if toro is going to help me out here but i don t have a lot of hope if they won t do a replacement that s it for me and toro there must be other machines out there that have at least a little more reliability label poor shredder poor shredder i have had three of these machines that failed just at warrantee time the shredder reduces about at most not hat is advertised the blower and vacume is adequate but not very good raking is quicker next time i will not replace this with the same product and seek another make label works good only used it once so far it was fairly easy to switch between blowing and vacuuming i just needed to figure out that it is much easier to blow all the leaves into a pile first instead of vacuuming them one by one doh a large pile of leaves lets say x4 filled the bag and then only filled my yw container a fourth of the way i m sure those will settle as well so it really saves space by having the leaves chopped this has a metal mulcher instead of others that have plastic so i think this is better like i said only used once but it seemed to work well label variable speed knob failure i bought the toro in may now it s december while i was blowing leaves for the final time this season the variable speed switch no longer worked it won t turn off and it won t change speeds now i can turn it off only by unplugging it is months the normal time before failure bummer label toro i replaces by year old toro with this model it is super i have negative comments they are minor attaching the vacuum tube is cumberson my old toro was easier to attach and remove also i do not like the way the extension cord is secured other than those minor items the device is superb it picks up leaves and small twigs and sticks easily and the metal blades are stronger than previous nylon plastic blades i would recommend this and would buy it again label it is what it is this was what i wanted but not pricey it is exactly what it looks like in the picture i just wished i could change the batteries instead of throwing it away when it dies label my favorite comedy i have all the seasons this show is the best charlie day is now one of my favorite actors he made this show and horibble bosses was awesome as well you got to love every person in this show it is and awesome cast and would not be the same withought any one of them season is vary funny due to mac being fat that took the cake dennis dee and frank best family ever haha oh and i guess charlie due to that is franks thought to be aboarded child label another sunny review this show never seems to get stale they always find a way to be original and hilarious another great season form the folks of philly label the best action movie ever this is agreat film an indiana jones is possible the best action hero of all time i still want to know why amazon says its rated r originaly it was going to be r but they changed it to pg so more people to see it pg in was like pg raiders of the lost ark is a great for kids around the age of i give it huge thumbs up label the voice of comfort anyone who can relate to the struggles of everyday human life can relate to tracy chapman s music she let s you know that she s been there too and that you re not alone label broke apart on first swat i got this as a gift a couple of months ago and finally pulled it out of the package i put batteries in pushed the button on the side and nothing happened no light or anything i figured i would try it on a fly and see if it worked even though the light didn t illuminate i saw a fly pushed the button swinged and crack the handle broke apart i was left holding the batteries and the racquet fell to the floor one star is too generous label product description is misleading while this product is suitable for quarantining small animals or transporting them to veterinary care this is not nor ever could be a permanent housing choice for any fish specimen given its size it cannot be heated safely so tropical fish would not fair well for long what i have used this product for was to provide temporary safe harbor inside my reef tank for a recently purchased cinnamon clownfish so that my existing clown didn t immediately tear him limb from limb and the two could familiarize themselves without injury this product is certainly useful in some aspects but certainly not as it s advertised as a permanent fixture home for a live animal or fish label linda ronstadt can t get any better she is perhaps the best living singer in the world in any language fabulous cd label beautiful singing linda sounds great the music sounds great this is a must have for any collection label picture shown is not the item the picture shown here is the handlifter assembly part no is not the handlifter it s only a couple of extra parts the picture should depict the parts not the actual lifter label wonderful production i am a huge michael jayston fan so this is a biased review but he is excellent in this part i enjoyed it very much it s also fun to see catherine de bourgh from the a e pride and prejudice when she was young other good actors too label satisfaction guaranteed was totally satisfied with my purchase broke my phone cord went online straight to amazon of course all purchases prior to this one were awesome ordered my headset was told that i would recieve my purchase on one day it actually came earlier then date given now how cool is that will never go anywhere else love you amazon label item did not work with the s10 returned item still have not received refund this item stated it worked with s10 but it did not i returned it and still have not received a refund label not worth the money was excited to get this product as a few of my co-workers have this brand name but sadly found out no one could hear me back to the handset label hellyeah fu king nasty this album is pure fu king sick chad is an amazing vocalist greg just as amazing on the guitar i have no following of nothingface but if this is any indication to what they do im going to become real fimiliar then you have somebody that needs no introduction what so ever on drums vinny paul i dont even have to put anything by his name vin has proved his importance over many many years this is the amaculate metal band you are covered on all corners cheers mother fu ers go getcha hellyeah label hellno what the hell mudvayne i thought that u guys were nt going to split i guest wrong why hellyeah label terribly unhelpful luckily i only checked this out from the library it s almost as if they didn t know the test content at all plus there were several glaring mistakes i recommend everyone stay away from this cliff s nd edition was the best cset multiple subject guide i found label if you want to feel prepared for the cset don t buy this book this book did an awful job at preparing me for the cset i spent weeks reading through the book and taking the practice tests only to walk into the exam open the test booklet and feel like i knew nothing that was in front of me i feel that i would have been better prepared if i had just walked in off the street and taken the cset with absolutely no review from this book on a side note there were also quite a few editing errors in the book a multiple choice question in a practice test with no answers to choose from for instance bottom line don t buy this book if you want to feel prepared for the cset label a must have for nursery start ups gotta say the author gives a realistic picture of starting a nursery business by the time you finish this you will have a clear picture of the business basics if you are looking for a book on how to grow plants look elsewhere this is a practicle guide to starting the business includes the web address for additional info exactly the information i needed label zzzzzzzzzz a box of tuneless overindulgent snoozefest riddled drivel rush said more on permanent waves than dt have on their entirecatalog label too many script errors also frustrating for kids claims to use some kind of adaptive process to alter difficulty of the game but this just results in a long list of repetitions of the same game before you get anywhere very frustrating for little kids label factory error with this game i truly believe that there was some kind of factory error with this product i researched and read about this version kindergarten advanced and the reviews said that the goal was to complete the tasks in order to get your car ready for the big race hence the picture on the box i purchased the software installed it and the newest jumpstart kindergarten world edition is what came up this is a completely different game that sells for more and is what people are talking about with the monthly subscription the disks were labeled correctly but the content was the wrong version after a lot of pleading the store finally took the product back it s unfortunate because the regular advanced version got good reviews but obviously this has happened to a lot of people so i m not going to take my chances again label how do you play these games my year old daughter is out there crying right now because this stupid game which doesn t come with any instructions just made her little doggie disappear and we can t find it and there are no directions there are only two games to play on the pet playground game and they are lame i feel like i wasted my money and we still can t find that stupid dog it s like torture for your kindergartener label too brief for real use the book is made up of a collection of editorials from fair the public-interest watchdog group the articles are short and not particularly incisive and focus on the usual transgressions of america s corporate-owned media as a reference source cohen and solomon s book is not particularly valuable the articles are simply too brief to provide much useful depth or information moreover the groupings lack real coherent unity that follow through on the theme still and all a revisit of upton sinclair s struggle against the entrenched wealth of his day s s provides useful perspective on today s media struggles and the beat goes on label not prime we love curious george we were very excited when we saw it was added to prime instant video however it is still trying to charge me for it label don t buy this drivel my toilet is more interesting high school effort at best i fast forwarded through it gave it away i give it buns down label car bra for envoy a good tight fit it was the only problem areas were the far corners of the bra but believe it was a good purchase and well worth the money label weak fortunately this book was part of a bundle and i did not have to pay for it if you are new to rts games then it might be of some use otherwise what person with any brains would not know to put weaker missile units behind sturdier melee ones i mean really it s that basic label a hidden treasure i discovered this music while researching ballet suites wonderful colorful orchestration some exquisite melodies i am researching to find more information about the man any posts would be appreciated label remarkable film once again another remarkable piece of work by aishwarya rai and ajay devgan bollywood drama about two lovers from the same village separated by an arranged marriage six years later they meet in calcutta and catch up on old times and learn surprising truths about one another wonderfully filmed with an o henry-style twist label a most interesting history cleveland amory best known for his writings for his love of animals first wrote this most interesting view of the city of boston boston is one of america s most well known cities and amory gives an insight into the fabric that makes up the social framework of the city gilded with facts that give the reader a chance to see how boston thinks such as tearing down the historical home of john hancock when the taxes went unpaid this book is fascinating because it is real truth is stranger than fiction and boston as presented here rings true the main drawback to the book is that one wishes an update on the world of the proper bostonians was available label very happy received the caliper very quickly very pleased with it it worksperfectly would recommend this item to anyone who wantsto check body fat on a regular basis label nothing to do with nin nothing to do with nin cept for the title it s mildly humorous but pretty stupid nonetheless label very well done this was a very well written very well researched biography it was an interesting read and the authors obviously knew exactly what they were talking about they interviewed a vast range of sources had all sorts of good quotes anecdotes and pictures i felt like i was getting the real deal this is the best bowie biography i ve read in case you re wondering i ve read five i m doing a report for my arts class this answers most of my questions about bowie my only regrets being that it was published in the mid-eighties so i don t get any info on what he s doing now label miraculous reading i found this book making me looooonnnnngggg for planning a trip to cabo the sea of cortez and all along baja i ordered this book so that i could help my daughter write a paper for one of her marine biology classes it had all the perfect ingredients habitat and ecology discussions cultures that affect the marine life whimsical and historical accounts of people places and events and a most interesting narrative i recommend this for a summer reading label great example of what atb can do wonderful mix of vocals and that mind numbing sound that atb brings to the record a great pick if you are a atb fan label save your money upon removing supposedly new unit from box discovered marred level adjustment screw indicating prior misuse unit did not work because of poor transmission and faulty female jack plug on transmitter more than days elapsed between the time i bought the unit and when it was first used and the vendor selling thru amazon refused to honor a refund or replacement citing their obscure return policy this device is poorly constructed cheaply made non-functional and in my opinion misrepresented as factory new when it appeared to be otherwise label very cool and enlightening toy another character that the little boy from ben can change into this larger action figure is very nice indeed it converts into a flashlight which again allows for more play time my kids wished that it did that and glowed int the dark as well but that s wishful thinking it s sturdy and well made i d suggest also picking up more than one if you have more than one kid because they ll end up fighting over it otherwise label not up to m usual high quality products i do like the fact that this stand has adjustable angles but am taken aback by the price design ratio the way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it the m engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product the elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair with two plastic attachments to it for this price a few extras should have been included i had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply cannot handle the weight overall it works ok but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect label fantastic these are the best document holders we had an ergonomic evaluation and document holders were recommended for several of the staff members these are large enough to put right in front of the monitor and hold two columns of documents you will need a monitor riser if you want it in front of your screen but then it makes a perfectly ergonomic setup label needs improvement and too expensive useful but you need a big desk to find room for this also the price is too much for what you get also kind of wobbly i would not recommend this for the price it should either be better designed or half the price and i don t mean half the list price i mean half the amazon price and even that would be pushing it label so much fun this dvd is amazing i ve never done a workout that was so much fun before i love how fast the hour goes by the instructor is great and gives all the right reminders i ll admit though this isn t for people who ve never exercised before it s super hard but worth it i ve already noticed a difference in my endurance after doing this dvd only five times in the past two weeks also there is some great instruction before the workout even starts on how to punch and kick correctly in all the different forms she uses in the workout i don t think there could be a better kickboxing dvd out there label surf city teresa please don t stereotype girls i consider surf city teresa very mediocre i wouldn t reccomend it to children with vicious dogs cats or other animals that might choke on the doll s shredded head hair feet or other parts that easily come off it is not very fun for children with little imagination as the dolls can get boring and end up either with their heads pulled off in the barbie pile or fed to the bulldog as barbie dolls go they can get boring after awhile and are not educational label don t buy them the new tdk music cd-rs no longer work in my pro cd recorder i ve never had a problem with tdk music cd-rs in the past but i ve tried several spindles of the new cd-rs with the new labels and packaging and they have been nothing but problems i have contacted tdk several times about it but no reply label dont use these for the philips cd recorder i bought packages of these and they were all defective not for digital audio music recorders i called tdk which make imation media they told me to check out each disk and send them the defective ones well all are defective so they are gonna send me the correct ones for my recorder my dual cd philips machine didnt recognize these disks which say tdk music the recorder rejected every one either it gave a error or said insert disc meanwhile it was in there i dont recommend these model discs for the philips dual cd recorder i always bought tdk all my life and since imation is involved i no longer buy them i use maxell only for the dual philips recorder i bought discs and work flawlessly if you have the philips cd-r dual deck use the maxells they are worth it they say on them cd-r music for digital audio min and are used for the philips dual deck label give it up william oh great another one more terrible music from william hung america s favorite american idol reject would somebody please give william the message we hated inspiration and we hate miracles happy summer even more these little messages that william does in the middle of the song are worthless i ve listened to them and it s almost like wow what a waste of time you don t buy the records to listen to the dialogue but then again why do you buy the records period in this case overall if you thought inspiration was funny chances are you ll love miracles happy summer but if you hated inspiration as much as i did than you ll hate miracles even more i wouldn t recommend this to anyone it s not funny in fact it s just embarrassing not recommended label he s hung you know you really have to give this guy a lot of credit his voice sounds like one of the really bad guys singing in the local karaoke bar but he s selling records doing it he s got more guts than anyone i know because he knows what some people think of his voice and he doesn t have a problem with it he loves it label tight i m surprised that no one has reviewed this album anyway this cd is great for those of you that like break beat music and bass this album is awesome not the best but definetly worth buying label this is florida breaks this cd is one of the backbone sets to the florida breaks sub-genre i believe this to be the height of rob-e s mixing talent label great crunch udi s has great crunch and flavor love the macadamia and dried pineapple addition it could use a few more of each of these as they seem to pour out in the first few bowlfuls and then you are left with none label this cd is full of pathetic screaming and bad lyrics this cd sucks why are these stupid bands dissing the us if they dont like it then get out nofx anti-flag and nothingface all suck and have no idea on politics i hate them and never will like them i heard ether on uranium and was like these dudes are soft and they suck i listened to the other songs and they arent really soft but his screams are horrible listen to below summer they kinda resemble nothingface but are times better dont support these anti-us losers label waste of money about bands in the us like this one sound exactly the same skeleton s only great song is murder is wanking everything else is mediocre save the money for something else cuz this one here ain t worth it i recommend slipknot disturbed system of a down static x mudvayne and sepultura label a different approach i think this step was a progression from violence in the direction of creating more melodic music in some cases like ether and beneath it worked on others it fell flat nothingface has always done best with songs that vary their tempo see breathe out from audio guide or for all the sin from violence in that regards machination works well but not as well then they have their heavy stuff which is certainly heavy i wish i was a communist here come the butchers but some of it seems kinda there the standout tracks on the album are ether all cut up and murder are masturbation however songs don t make an album great there is a bit of filler in there that kinda takes away from it hopefully nothingface s label problems will motivate them to go back to making music like everyday atrocity label disappointed i was very excited to find this chucky set my son has been wanting one for a while but upon receiving my package and viewing it i was very disappointed my son planned on collecting them never opening it and the packaging is damaged and ripped on the box that holds the dolls label i m glad i happened on this product by accident i found this when i was looking for a canister that would coordinate with my kitchen this is great i don t fix coffee every day at home but really enjoy my fresh weekend coffee this keeps the coffee fresh for the longer period that it takes me to use a full bag it has worked as i expected it is battery-powered aa which makes it really more versatile i would recommend this product label never worked since i received the product it never worked very disappointed don t know what to do as i don t live in the usa label comedy rap with a twist my brother blockhead along with his pal jar have put together a fun and not at all serious piece of work for those of you who like a little comedy with your rap you will love this album ithink blockhead and jer are at there best when doing full tracks and not skits the best being back in da dayz witch if the labal is smart will clean up and put out to radio it has smash all over it anyway if your in the mood for a laugh and are a rap fan and you want something a little differant this is for you being a member of the family my congrats goes to blockhead my brother and jer on a job well done i only wish more rapers wouldn t takes themeseles so seriously label wish i would have passed on this one i bought this cd knowing i probably wouldn t like it and i like it less than i thought i would half of this album contains stupid skits and the songs just aren t very funny the novelty wears off after the st couple of listens the highlights of the album in my opinion are the that blockhead produced beer back in da daiz and chapstick which is only like seconds long as murs says opinions are like rap careers everybody s got one but i honestly think the average year old would find this cd a little childish label rita mulcahy s pmp exam prep turned on some lights rita s book is candid and straight forward the book was a great compliment to the pmbok giving hints tricks and great practice tests i studied the pmbok first then used rita s book to round out my knowledge i only took hours minutes out of hours to take the test and passed label highly overrated this book does present some material well but it is more of an advertising teaser so you ll buy the whole kaboodle paying several hundred dollars or worse you ll be motivated to take her course paying thousands of dollars pmp exam prep has definitely been a growing industry the certification is by itself overly hyped up sometimes it all seems like a scam one can pass pmp by just reading a bunch of prep books just because someone is a pmp doesn t mean a squat label truly an exam prep book this book is a must for those preparing for the pmp exam i bought this book after researching including book reviews like this one a lot of books i think this one stood out for me to buy i am really pleased with the content and alignment of this book i also purchased the pmp fastrack simulation software from rmc that software really iced the cake my confidence level went up ok i was checking if you are really reading this my confidence level went up significantly and i was completely prepared i passed the pmp with a whopping i don t think i could have passed without the simulation software good luck to all you soon to be pmps label excellent study guide i think this book is a must for anyone taking the test it should not be your only source but recommend using this as your primary study material for the weeks leading up to the test her practice exam questions are very similar in nature to the actual test label recommended for your listening pleasure just saw them live from the moshpit at the house of blues in l a after listening to this import cd for a while a really good heavy piece band with a good future ahead of them a cd you can listen to start to finish without skipping tracks label wonder what s next answer more killer music by chevelle this is chevelle s fourth album and they are not slowing down at all i would rank this as their second best record behind wonder what s next it will be hard to beat that one but they come close on this they have a thick chunky sound that can be thunderous at times and it sounds great with a good subwoofer the singer really sounds a lot like maynard from tool at times but that is a good thing musically they sound nothing like tool though these guys are one of the best hard rock bands around and they never let me down they are on the heavier end of the hard rock spectrum just so you know label needed a break so rather than write a lengthy and seemingly insightful bunch of s t im just going to say that this album did not impress me at the first few listens i put it down in disappointment for a few months i then put it back in the player for a spin and i was greatly surprised its not wonder and its not point but in its own right its still a good album grab it label nice idea but doesn t work save your time and your money i bought this to use in teaching at the university i installed the software and found that the device didn t work i called technical service at seiko but apparently this item was discontinued several years ago a nice gentleman attempted to help me but it was clear that he had never seen or setup or used the device i was on the line with him quite a while and apparently his supervisor felt enough was enough so i was told to try something and call back if i had problems i was disgusted with seiko and contacted my seller and requested a refund he was very nice about it credited me that day and didn t even want the device back bottom-line don t waste your money seiko gave up on it ages ago and they don t support it label nonplussed this product does everything advertised i just wish it came with functional recognition software it s not enough to be able to e-mail jpgs of my notes to someone else i need my notes reliably converted into text as another reviewer so eloquently put it this is nothing that can t be accomplished with a crayon and a scanner the ooh and ahh factor of watching one s handwriting pop up on the screen isn t worth if you want a way to get pictures of your handwriting from point a to point b stick with your fax machine for now label sugar crack euphoria hardwired both cd s contain the best in breakbeat happyhardcore that scott brown has to offer the best song in my opinion is his cover of gigi d agostino s i ll fly with you quite simply the best song on disc there is also a remix of scott browns elysium the song that got me hooked on his music if you have any of the happy2bhardcore albums or scott browns previous releases then this album will not disappoint if your new to happy hardcore this album will treat your ears to one of the most hyper sub-genres of techno the first disc seems to go darker towards the end but other than that no complaints all around it s an awesome cd label perfect for my friend i was glad to get this for my friend it came quickly and i was pleased with the service thanks label the state of northeast hardcore this is the best comp i have i like almost all the bands alot even though i hadn t heard many of them the artwork is intense and well done and the production for a comp is really consistent standouts beyond reason i am sleeping with the bass playa compression proof of purchase three girls and one lucky guy a must buy stars label not a great stove i am not happy with my bosch gas free-standing convection range one burner keeps clicking after i turn it off this forces me to disconnect the stove i just had it fixed for a couple of months ago and now it is broken again my advice don t buy one label smaller than i expected although the dimensions say x x inches the dimensions of the actual plastic tank not including the cover are x x inches this is equal to gallons i was expecting a tank that could hold around gallons because i foolishly used the dimensions listed here i noticed that my tank could hold less than gallons when i was doing a water change and noticed i had only siphoned out gallon of water and the water level was under the halfway point in the tank other than that this is a pretty good tank if used temporarily for a sick fish like i am doing label waste of time overall the story was okay-it at least kept me interested until the end-only because i was expecting some of my questions which kept me reading to be answered i am more confused now than when i started reading it i understand that there is a sequel on the way but i wont read it because i didn t care about the characters and a sequel seems like overkill-she could have easily ended the book also her dialogue is lacking and unbelieveable and she uses a very irritating form of third person writing she also needs a decent editor because i am a teacher and i had an overwhelming urge to get out my red pen and correct the grammatical and spelling errors myself don t waste your time label testify darn it is it me or does rage against the machine put out the best singles i have battle of la and i like testify and guerillia radio i can only imagine how much money rage rakes in with these awsome singles i wish they would just make longer limited ep s or something this is awsome but rage should take example of incubus and make a limited worthy ep label do not buy this crap i bought this item in may of and here it is february and it has died on me it was originally bought to replace the factory frayed cord which still works but i wanted to be on the safe side and not fry my laptop i have since purchased an original from hp it may cost more but at least it will work for years as opposed to much less read the reviews and you won t be sorry label not a genuine hp product like others have said on here before this is not an hp product it is a cheap knock off it is better as it has an led indicator but other than that it was much worse then my hp original charger this charger got much hotter then a true hp charger which indicates to me that it is not as efficient from taking ac to dc conversion very well wish chargers would have the plus standard that most desktops have but they don t if they did than plus certified products wouldn t be as warm and you use less energy i digress bottom line has an led indicator it chargers up your battery but it will get much hotter then a genuine hp product it may not last as long as a real charger but i have not tested that out label never received i finally went to hallmark and bought it there it was a gift for my mother but i read it first and it s a very dear little book label not very inspiring i started reading this book and it so filled with a mishmash of junk i gave it to the local library for its book sale label a golden book not as good as the earlier books in the series but still very enjoyable in the last couple of peabody books the characters were getting stale in the tomb of the golden bird they come back to life so that you want to know more about them and what is going on in their lives like a long awaited letter from an old friend although the master criminal is not developing to be the strong character i had hoped for with peters historical discription of egypt you can easily imagine what life was like back then this sounds trite but it is always one of the more enjoyable aspects of a peter s book so why not five stars the mystery what there was of it was weak almost like an after thought i love the other non peabody mysteries maybe it is time for ms peters to take a break from the emersons label i m a fan but this book was disappointing not up to the usual standard it was slow moving and bogged down a number of times at the end you wondered what was the point it lacked plot interest it just meandered through the story and a lot of plot tie-ins from previous books were not well done i love the series but this was a poor effort compared to the others label th entry in series another delight tomb of the golden bird by elizabeth peters is the th and possibly last book in her fabulous amelia peabody series the entire emerson clan is back in egypt for howard carter s discovery with some guidance from emerson of course of tutankhamon s tomb emerson peeves off lord carnavon and the entire family is then banned from the most wondrous find in all of egyptology s history in the midst of this uproar sethos has returned with news of a possible conspiracy to bring down the shaky peace that has settled across the middle east since the end of the great war the plot as usual is irrelevant what matters is the snappy repartee the always delightful amelia sticking her nose into everyone s business and of course a pair of star-crossed lovers it s standard peters stuff but she makes it look elegant and easy i do hope this isn t the end label disappointing i have read every book in the amelia peabody series and was anxiously awaiting this one the first three-quarters appeared to be painfully written it wasn t until the last sixth of the book that the quintessential peters writing style emerged given the interwoven tale with the historical events it could have been more in line with other peabody novels label not exceptional given the reputation of the author this is the first novel by salvatore i read i expected a lot more the cleric quintet is at best average-quality mass-production fantasy writing full of cliches one-dimensioned characters and with a predictable storyline that might be good for a rpg session but is definitely too simple-minded for a novel series while i have read worse i would not buy the book again and am thinking hard whether it is worth giving the drizzt novels a try label rolf wallet thank you for some reason i like this particular wallet and none others no stores seem to carry it any longer label culture and conduct it was required by my intro to anthropology professor but i found it to be a necessary evil i enjoyed many of its stories but it wasn t overly gripping bear in mind it served as a text it had the necessary vocabulary and terms needed to further our understanding in class and to contribute in discussions so not bad overall label terrible quality dangerous product do not buy i originally bought this as a second mic for my daughter s karaoke machine barely a month after purchase the plastic coating around the wires at the base separated from the base itself exposing the electrical wires i will try to include a picture i assumed my kids had done something to it and ordered another because it seemed like a decent price for what we wanted this time however we ve been extremely careful and it s only been used under my supervision and not used that often it took maybe two months but it happened again i just feel fortunate that i noticed it before my kids used it so they didn t electrocute themselves this product shouldn t even be sold i am disgusted i would give it no stars if that were an option label bad cable good device good cable but together does not match total worthless product bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad paid my money for a piece of garbage label excelent tropical plant source book we are new gardeners in the caribbean this book is an excellent source book for us as we increase the size and sensory effects of our garden label tolerable i have a small dog and after the recent teeth cleaning by our vet to the tune of i figured any attempt to clean teeth would be better than nothing i ve always brushed my dogs teeth so i was disappointed that i wasn t doing enough to keep the tarter at bay this oral rinse is very different and a bit challenging to use at first my dog wasn t too keen on the long plastic tube and i ve figured out that it s best to have the liquid nearly to the tip of the tube before inserting it in my dogs mouth if i don t have the liquid in the tube the amount of air blowing in my dogs mouth leads her to shy away from it all it takes is a quick squeeze on either side of the dogs mouth and you re done my dog doesn t seem to be bothered by the taste if there is one overall i m hoping that this well help keep my dogs teeth cleaner but i won t really know until next year label required text this is a required text at my school but after having read the first chapters there is almost nothing of value that i have read i have spoken to several people that have used this text for the class in prior semesters and they told me that they had stopped reading it after the first several chapters also label kindle version i cannot tell you how disappointed i am in the kindle version of this book i just bought my kindle and there are a considerable amount of mispelledwords the book however is a great book but i would advise reframing from purchasing the kindle version label he will enjoy this a small project and legos are way overpriced but grandson likes it because it has figure of a person which he uses a lot he makes many interesting things by mixing these pieces with other sets label do not use wmp11 with hp pavilion after wasting an enormous amount of time over a week i found that the linksys wmp11 causes my hp pavilion with amd cpu to freeze hard and neither hp nor linksys were able to resolve i even tried returning the wmp11 for a replacement in case it was bad but the replacement did exactly the same thing i just changed to a trendnet tew-pi wireless pci card that works great the problem with the wmp11 was complicated to diagnose because it connected fine if no data was transferred no problem but once you start transferring data thru the wmp11 it would crash hard freeze the system within a small random interval minutes buyer beware label linksys wreless b pci card the item came earlier than expected was easy to install and works great it is not compatible with windows unfortunately which i did not know but works fine with windows xp label flies like a rock you ll get lots of exercise running after this so called kite because all it does is crash label ready to crash airplane the kite utterly sucks i had a old airplane kite that i had flown off the back of a bike crashed an excess of times and all i had to do was duct tape some places up and it would fly like new it flew much better than this kite by far this kite crashes everytime you can see it is inevitable just by how it flys the wind ends have no support so they are just folding in as it flys causing rolls the propellor works but is incredibly cheap because all the blades are pointing in different directions there is also a cockpit rod that must be pushed in to expand the top the rod needs to be pushed in and held in place by a velcro strap that basically comes out every time the plane crashes a k a everytime this kite is a joke it says ready to fly in seconds it took me and my friend a good minutes because the pictures were very unclear in the end we assumed how to assemble it and tried different configurations but all ended up you guessed it crashing label beware of incompatibility problems unable to install the product was not compatible with my computer system label best in its field invaluable for any would be sociologist or anyone else interested in socio-criminolgy or deviance or statistics both authors display incredible method intelligence and craft i thoroughly enjoyed this book and it was assigned label turn up the volume purchased these headphones for my son to use with his portable cd mp3 player the sound was ok but the headphones are not very efficiant to hear enough sound you had to turn the volume all the way up even with the volume up high the headphones just did not deliver label the best dvd burner on the market came as a pioneer drive in retail box took about mins to install under winxp burns dvd-r at x great feature dvd-r blanks are also dropping in price daily for the price it is a good buy label okay keyboard cleaner this is an okay keyboard cleaner but same thing could be done with a box of q-tips and some alcohol for under a dollar this item is way overpriced for what it does update i am changing my rating to stars this item is overpriced useless junk fortunately amazon s refund policy allowed me to get a full refund label amazing prequel this book is a great prequel to the dragonlance chronicles it relays the story of the power-hungry mage raistlin and his muscle-bound brother caramon raistlin starts out as a child and grows to be in his early s when he takes the test at the tower of wayreth i think this is an amazing book and recommend it to anyone who has read the dragonlance chronicles margaret weis does a great job of keeping the reader in suspense and giving great background information on the group that was in the dragonlance chronicles brothers in arms is the sequel to this book buy them both now label excellent really good to read after you ve read chronicles because you just have to know more about raistlin label its great it really answers my questions about raistlin you wouldn t beleive the kind of life this powerful magi has gone through this story depicts the losses wins pain and love that has happened through his life i guarantee that you will like it label a great insight into raistlin majere s past a wonderful story that will satisfy anyone looking to know the background of the sly one without ruining the story or spoiling the plot this book details raistlin s youth and test at the tower of the magi this book reveals as much of raistlin s sensitive side as it does his abrasive side i would recommend reading the dragonlance chronicles trilogy dragons of insert season insert adjective and the entire twins trilogy before reading this book because there are some slight contradictions that are cleared up in this novel label high quality this product works exactly as intended opens doors open and close windows and honks horn a little childish but fun works as it should label ms a jolie is an amazing stunt-woman great dvd worth getting i can t believe angelina jolie does her own stunts looking at the extra features is a real eye-opener what do they save for the stunt crew the semi-lethal stuff label don t waste your money this movie plot is extremely predictable even by action movie standards i am still trying to figure out how angelina jolie keeps getting selected for these roles if you have seen tomb raider or mr and mrs smith or wanted then you have already seen this movie at least once move on label wow it was bad i can t believe i made it all the way through the dvd without turning it off it is horrible the story is incredibly predictable the action is about as realistic as star wars and i can t believe i am going to say this jolie looks too skinny and not nearly as attractive as she usually does do yourself a favor and save you money for something else this one is a stinker label salt dvd very high in adventure and a good ending very happy i believe that this is one of angelina jolie better action movies another great mystery movie of hers is the tourist label salt dvd new dvd delivered with alternate endings and special features for some reason would not play on my pioneer combo recorder player some pixelation on my samsung player worked fine on the sony dvd player the movie is action and suspensse well acted and the action sequences are out-standing you ll want to watch this one more than once the dvd was shipped and delivered very quickly label salt at this point questioning whether i make any further purchases on amazon because of moral hazard the dvd salt was sent to me it was blank there was nothing on the dvd sent numerous email s i have not received a reply nor a refund nor a new movie so at this point questioning whether this system actually has any purpose at the point i will no longer put my information on the site and considering withdrawing all together label it was good some scenes alittle silly like it was overall a good movie only downside for me was how she moved around and got away so easily jumping from truck to truck and the other things she pulled off in my mind would never happen otherwise it s a movie worth seeing label great movie angeline plays a great female action heroine this movie hopefully they can make more of these great visuals quality of the movie and overall a good action flick label what kind of ending is that after all the excitement full of twists turns it ends flat they don t even finish it it s like there will be a continuation a part the lack of ending ruined it for me label mr bourne you ve got a lovely daughter girls as tough as you are something rare or perhaps the song should be for she s a jolie good fellow angelina jolie as jack bauer jason bourne leaping tall buildings with a single bound almost beating the stuffing out of numerous assailants performing near-miracles on command through a particularly ridiculous plot ultimately such films are merely flimsy vehicles for the numerous high-energy chase fight scenes and as such i find them ultimately unsatisfying except for the bourne films i found that matt damon was able to breathe life into jason bourne much more than angelina was with evelyn salt so it comes down to taste if you like things where the hero ine kicks the living daylights out of a series of baddies at regular intervals and can ignore the flimsy plot that allegedly connects these individual instances of utter mayhem this is for you if however you like a plot that makes some sort of sense in the real world it isn t label salt had to return the dvd as it was not compatible for the united states had i realized that i never would have ordered it label good old spy flick as another reviewer stated if you like a good spy flick you should like this there is the constant is she or isn t she question which always makes for a good suspense film i was pretty impressed with the dc scenes as i live here it was a pretty good mix of real scenes and some staged sets all in all a good film that said the whole video on demand concept needs to ramp up the picture quality to full-screen and not a dumbed-down version of the sound quality could be better still no closed-caption which i really need if you want quality and features then go with blu-ray if you want convenience with the downloading then video-on-demand is the way to go label it stinks i had this card put in my hp that has windows xp and it stinks i play everquest and it is blocky flickers and now i cannot even play it i tried down loading new drivers and all that did was make me have to reboot i totally think this card is a waste of money label how did this album get to product one word and one word only crap all this guy does it say bad words in a song say nonsense and nonsense over and over again i have no idea why some people like this guy just save your money save your time save your ears and do not buy this album label boooooring i have read almost every book written by lori wick and i think her latest ones are just not that great this book leads you to believe it is a romance set in the south pacific and will take place during the war the plot actually had tremendous potential well the bulk of the book is set in california with one of the lead characters the navy man absent from every chapter for about half the story i could care less about girls shopping and altering clothing or the arrival of a pet kitten there are three main things wrong with this book boring boring boring i realize all three points are the same but it is such an important one i feel i must repeat it i look for books that i can t put down i had a very difficult time even wanting to pick this one up i think ms wick should take a break from writing until she can weave a yarn as great as her earlier works you d be better off reading some of those label i couldn t finish it usually i love wick s books and have sincerly enjoyed her tuckermills books and have read all of her other novels enjoying pretence and others the most but this book was terribly hard to get into i actually couldn t finish it and gave it to my husband to trade for commentaries he s a seminary student i was really disappointed because when i learned wick had written a wwii novel i was excited but my excitement was misplaced label lori wick i can t stand lori wick books i used to love them until i realized that real people are nothing like her characters all the women are gorgeous all the men are handsome caring and wonderful there are no real men or anybody like that her books are just fairy tales that would never come true in real life and i don t plan on wasting any more of my time reading that garbage label but not the record company though the song is a strong one and the photo of morrissey as a priest is hilarious the thought of spending this kind of money for two songs is far more blasphemous than anything you are the quarry indeed label a super talent i was lucky enough to see eric martin play in the san francisco bay area a few weeks ago his voice is as strong as ever and does the ablum even greater justice why do they only give us five stars to choose label buyer beware not as advertised please do not purchase based on the dimensions sabrina silver advertises they are not mm wide and are a lot closer to mm all other dimensions are correct i had contacted the seller numerous times but they refuse to change this information and will not refund my shipping costs even though the product is misrepresented and the pair i had received had a hinge not the post that was defective hinge was not filed and very sharp to point where you could pop a balloon with it i was looking for a very small but wide huggie earring and going by the dimensions thought this was the pair i had been searching for it was not for anyone looking for a wide silver huggie earring stuller makes a great quality product and worth the extra i will never do business with a company that thinks you are not entitled to a full refund for a misrepresented damaged product that they send you label orginal problems fixed for nice product i recieved this drive at the beginning of march after a week i started having trouble with the drive door it would not stay shut the cendyne repackaged verbatim i was told was really a verbatim repackaged lite-on after some tricky dos firmware work i relabeled the drive loaded the lite-on firmware update and it works like a charm love it got it here cheap label horrible i read this book while on a trip to africa i actively search out fast paced books with at least one intelligent character and a compelling theme the reviewers back cover seemd to support my thought that this book was worth a read i don t think i ve ever been so disappointed slow start poorly developed characters an intelligent character that was anything but an author character with zero writing skills confusing mid-section and a drink of water for an ending i was so disappointed with the book that i actually left it on british airways backseat pocket and hadwrote a note to the next reader don t waste your time the only thing that is actually a mistery about the book is why a few people rieks their names and reputations talking it up total lies finally this is the very first time i ve ever written a review about a book normally i won t waste my time however in this case i felt obligated to warn potnetial future readers don t read you will be gravely disappointed label ridiculous i did not believe one word of this story the main character a woman is completely unbelievable i felt no suspense at any point near the end when she keeps asking where is a major unseen character and the person she s asking does nothing but change the subject she has no clue whereas the reader feels hit over the head with the obvious if you want real suspense read thomas perry label not convincing as it proceeds this novel starts out okay with a likable pretty heroin in an unusual situation and good writing toobut the second half of the book is a far reach way beyond what can be convincing the key bit that has her haul around a long heavy extension ladder and then climb it to the third-story window of a hospital with a two-foot bolt cutter tucked in her belt would be a feat worthy of wonder woman then to expect the bad guy to come to a desolate meeting point alone and unarmed is the height of naivety and those are just examples of why i became so disappointed in what promised to be a good read label in your face left-wing slumlords well here you have it one of your own dennis miller being another darling of the left who has awakened post leaving the reservation my hope is that the left will just continue their weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth as their database dwindles and moves inexorably to the well-deserved ash heap of history get used to it chumps there s nothing you can do to stop it oh and in your predictable anti-first amendment fashion do try to quash my comments because they make you yes they do weep wail and gnash your teeth right good label great resource for ayurveda excellent book it gives the energetics characteristics and recommended usage for lots of herbs both eastern and western an incredible resource for anyone interested in ayurveda also it is well written and simple so it suits the novice and expert alike label a survey both wide and deep hello about a month ago i submitted a review of this book but apparently you rejected it for it has never appeared can you tell me why it was four-stars and a generally favorable review reflecting my rather good opinion of it and seeming to me acceptable especially since there is only one other customer review on record please let me hear from you thanks label this should be the bible of dog training this book is eye opening gives the dog a lot of credit for figuring things out on his own in my mind turns out the author is justified very satisfied opened up my eyes on giving the pup a lot more leeway after mo i can say the system is sound i used it on a rescue pup with some trust issues and at yrs of those months with us he had himself an awesome season started out a little slow but as he went he learn then he had one day where he just broke out and never looked back very satisfying to see where he came from to where he is i am convinced he would not have responded to heavy handed training label first-time gun dog owner review i enjoyed reading the book in preparation for the arrival of my first gun dog pup though personally inexperienced in training i have hunted over friends dogs for several years and have spent enough time with dog people to have a sense of what can work this book presents an excellent overview for the first-time or experienced trainer label a great read for any dog owner joan s book certainly helped me when i became the new owner of a hunting dog eight years ago the book focuses on the time period before the arrival of the puppy through the first critical year of a dog s life the information in this book would be useful for any new dog owner whether the dog is a hunting breed or not i would say this is a must read for anyone who plans on hunting over their dog i know that when it is time for the next puppy in a year or two i will be reading this book again highly recommended label always reads low here we always get temperature readings below degrees when reading people without fevers first time i tried the screen read degrees f and the readings seem to vary quite a bit also the instructions say you are supposed to send the unit back to mabis every was it two years for re-calibration at a cost of about maybe i don t know how to use it but we were quite disappointed label not worth the money item looks better on screen than in your hands when you first turn on the thermometer lcd screen says lo for low battery no off button to conserve battery power temperature is instantaneous but inconsistent especially if taken in one ear and then the next usually off by a whole degree it s far worse when taken simultaneously you get different results every time unreliable inconsistent not worth the money bad choice label good thermometer easy to use this is a good thermometer easy to use it makes a noise when it s done reading your temperature which makes it easy to take your own i also like that you don t have to use any disposable parts which is sanitary enough if you re using it just on your family label m monitor review purchased at amazon com this was much much larger than i needed or wanted it was way too big i wanted something about that size label tv stand bought this to use as a tv stand on a table on our screened porch works great and is exactly what we needed to use during any kind of weather label way massive thin material i ordered one size up and these were so large they stretched several inches below my foot i m going to have to cuff and hem them i m wear and never have this problem with length in xl also what s up with the crappy thin material like cheap pajama bottoms i had a pair of these from several years back and the material was quality fleece lasted very well with these i don t expect more than a season or two out of them i wouldn t wear my actual size because they aren t flattering and show every lump and bump but a size up and they drape a bit and provide at least some modesty i m not going to return them because they will work under a big shirt and i m not finding anything better out there but this is really the last clothing i buy from russell label very very thin material these pants are light and comfortable but the material is very very thin just about see-thru thin the fabric may hold up well but i m not planning on wearing these out of the house the material is just too sheer for me to feel comfortable in public with them the pants i got are the oxford color which is not cotton so other colors might not be as bad these do have a very polyester feel label greatness i had no problem with these sweatpants even as i washed in dried them they did not shrink they are true to fit label kinda sucks to play but has nice special effects unseen in any other game i think it s about time gamers demanded their games have spectacular new special effects and be fun to play this game was not fun to play i would rather fast forward through a video of someone else completing the game just so i could see the special effects and design and not have to hack out hour after hour of horrible game play this design team was just chosen to do the next gen design for a upcoming jedi title it had better be fun as well as devastatingly beautiful label door problem i purchased a black and decker tro toast-r-oven just a month ago and it works ok however because the handle is so big or the toaster is so low i could not get the door to stay open to get my toast out the handle hits the counter top and will flip back to close i had to cut a board to put the toaster on so the door would stay open if you buy this product get it from a store you can take it back to if your toaster door don t stay open label product might be good but i received duds after many years of receiving good products through amazon this one was sorry to say a dud twice the first toast-r-oven was received with the knob assembly and chrome behind it pulled away from the body of the toaster amazon very quickly sent a replacement but this one had the toaster button stuck in the in position toasted a piece of bread to see if the button would come out but it didn t we re returning this one too the toast was nicely browned though so if you get a good one keep it label toaster switch defective within mos the toaster switch broke after reading other people s reviews it seems that this is a common defect also haven t had any luck using it to cook other foods only good for toasting recommend staying away from this brand you ll end up paying more in long run to replace it with another one buy better brand quality to begin with i learned my lesson label bad luck with b d i had one many moons ago it was a piece of junk it wouldn t toast correctly or consistently and it wouldn t broil correctly on the other hand it did last for at least years right up until the day i took a shotgun to it after buying a delonghi but that s another story label stay away from black and decker i have bought many b d toaster ovens over the years however in the last years the quality has gone seriously downhill screws are missing toasting is erratic and uneven the finish is peeling off my daughter had to return two new ones within two weeks i am about to buy a cuisinart b d is an abomination label easy read lives up to title i m sort of cheating on this one since thane works for me i get to see the book way before y all do it will actually publish at pages or so due to the great depth to which he goes into each topic in spite of the length it goes quickly i like his approach with lots of examples and his use of the most current cobol standards combined with years of business experience on mainframes and pcs his advice makes sense works and can be easily expanded upon even though i ve been writing cobol for years i learned some ways to improve my program structure i evaluated the book with the idea of using it as a text for a credit hour freshman or sophomore class in compter science and found that it should do nicely in fact the proposal is on the dean s desk right now with a request for spring semester introduction label decent album for stevie b fans i finally got a copy of this used after looking for it for years i wasn t sure what to expect but after a few listens i say this album has some hidden gems for freestyle fans the lead track since you ve been gone away and you are the one are good tracks that don t recycle that often used planet rock beat if you like slow jams i love my love today and give me just a little more time are the ones to go for the rest of the album is ok while i like can you hear me now and it s so good i noticed that they both seemed to be using the same beat with different lyrics which was a little disappointing the other songs depend on your tastes i didn t hate any of them which is probably the best news this album probably won t convert anyone who wasn t a stevie b fan before however for any fans who like his stuff it s worth tracking down label hummingingbirds this is one great book i resentley had to do a report on hummingbirds i looked in many books but none of them seemed to have the information i needed to know then i found this book it s full of great information on hummingbirds i found out every thing i needed to know i got a on my report you have to read this book label a glorified usa today accounting of a terrorist network if you pay attention to the news read newspapers and or news magazines then this book will add little to your existing understanding of this group the book does a very good job of detailing the minutia of the al-qaida membership inasmuch as the membership list is important maybe to the cia the minutia was a lost effort because most of the membership biographies were very short and cryptic at best i bought the book expecting that it would articulate the group s activity financiers state sponsors directions goals and ideological underpinnings the title lead me to that conclusion the book does not do this and for that reason i was dissapointed the only high point of the book for me was the re-print of bin laden s speeches pass on this book label works great had a hard time reaching the bleeder screw on my ford f150 not anymore works and fits great with my vehicle label indo-dance supreme graduates of mp3 com natarajxt on the recently formed nutone label subsidiary of canada s nettwerk put on a great show mixing the traditional indian sarod sitar and esraj with electronics to produce a series of tracks that vibrate pulse flow and move in perfect east-west fusion nataraj is one of the names and incarnations of shiva from the hindu pantheon brahma vishnu shiva while shiva is often referred to as the destroyer in his nataraj form he is lord of the dance and these guys sure do a terrific job of paying homage to their namesake one of the most popular musical cultures to be associated with worldbeat world fusion indian music can just as easily be diluted and considerably weakened as it can be hugely enhanced because they re sharp guys natarajxt knows this and they reflect that knowledge in their music this is one of the better examples of indian-influenced worldbeat for sure label worthless buyer beware this item is plastic it s nothing more than a glorified child s toy it is nowhere near the value of what they have it priced at the shadowbox does not have a clear cover and is completely open the dagger is one piece of poorly painted molded plastic and what s worse it s not even straight the dagger has a downward curve that wouldn t be seen by the naked eye as it hangs but is noticeable if you remove it and hold it at eye level neca should be embarrassed label big disappointment with kasparov s name on the title page i was looking forward to analysis on par with his other pergamon cadogan books on matches new world chess champion and london leningrad championship games i was sadly disappointed the analysis in here is very weak on the level of what keene usually provides in his hack jobs i recommend the book by karpov s team isbn instead label need the updated version i bought this to take with me on a trip to asia the flight takes much longer than my ipod s battery would last and this seemed to be a great solution however when i put fresh batteries in and connected my ipod nothing happened i then bought new batteries just in case only with the same result i contacted apc and they sent me a replacement long story made short it produced the same result thus i contacted apc again and this time they sent me the newer model which does not have that tiny wire extension instead you plug the ipod s usb cable directly into the main unit the unit also has an led light which lets you know that it actually works my advice skip this version and go for the newer model label not the best but gets the job done my husband and i bought this for our baby girls room since it matched her decor and we needed a hamper when we got it we noticed that we had to re-sew on the velcro that holds the washable cloth on the frame the cloth is too small for the frame and it easily folds back together label useless card for dell axim pda i bought a new card and it failed in just a couple of days from literature review it appears that this card has known issues with axim pda s and other devices i contacted san disk customer service and i am yet to hear from them stay away from this junk label doo rag this product may be good for a very young child but not for a grown man the doo rag was way to small the only good thing about it was the color very poor quality product it does not deserve any stars at all label a great guide for the mushroom lover i have read quite a few mushroom books in my course of book reviewing but i would have to say this is one of the best this book has great coverage on propagation cultivation identification and collecting i like the decision to leave out mushrooms of unknown edibility because it makes the book much more manageable the photography is excellent i liked the addition of habitat shots of where certain mushrooms grow this would surely help anyone who is a collector this book stayed on track and didn t try to be all things to all people for instance in the cultivation section they tell you what to read for more information depending on the type of mushroom this book has great information on all levels and is helpful guide for the novice to expert gardener label wow loved it when my friend recommended this book to me i was suspicious because he couldn t explain what he loved so much about it but i can it s inspiring it made me think about my life and what i want to get from it actually it made me think of lots of things too many to mention here and it just gets better as you read great story i can t wait to read the sequel and find out what happens next label almost all questions are from pmp exam prep th edition deeply disappointed most of the questions are from rita s another book pmp exam prep th edition buying pmp exam prep th edition is enough don t waste your money on this one label great bag for the price but lasted only months i got this for so i have no complaints it s holds tons of stuff have lots of organizing pockets and compartments and doesn t look cheap at all unfortunately the seam between the fabric and the synthetic leather part of the top handle came apart and i ended up tossing it in the garbage after less than months label decent guide for visitors to major texas forts this magazine-like book describes about three dozen forts that held a key role in the indian campaigns thus only major forts are included the alamo forts brown bliss mcintosh duncan belknap stockton davis to name just a few when and where each fort was established a brief historical account and the state of the fort today are given in varying degrees of thoroughness the last chapter is barely a listing of various less important forts many of these forts are today state or county parks and offer something of interest for the visitor to see a handy guide for travelers visiting these sites label seattle wa illustrations for the ipad kindle edition are in black and white even though the format supports color which is sort of a huge issue for a book about graphics and visual imagery label the song everyone wants is not here its a song by az from a group called mobstyle holla at jekylindustriez yahoo com label what are you all talking about i ll give this stars just for the beats as far as being cutting edge and radically new and whatever other great sounding description these reviewers want to leave this album is not elementary school kids could make an album more intelligible than this if you want to listen to this cd you re definitely gonna need to be on something i can t imagine how one could stand it otherwise label mimzyfied i have seen two great childrens movies this year and this is one of them the other is bridge to terabithia two children find a box that holds unusual items as they discover the items uses they begin to unfold a map to another time and place as the items gain notice from adults they begin to scare adults afterall anything alien must be bad finally it comes down to whether the parents believe in their children or not thankfully they do and so when it becomes obvious who sent the items the children are able to help them i highly recommend this wonderful movie for the whole family label what couldn t stand it stopped watching after the teacher got involved with the science fair about an hour in i think i thought that maybe the movie was a slow builder lots of exposition that would eventually pay off all i got was some half-hearted acting a pair of not-that-cute kids who carry around alien technology you d think there would be more drama it also had some kind of preachy the blood of the earth is on your hands if you don t tune into nature more often message can t say if it paid off or clarified but i was done wasting my time label philip leitch this is a truly great book it gave me all the answers i was looking for and i was looking for a lot of answers the section on strings windows strings ccombstr is indispensable chapter i can t understand how people could rate this book badly i tried the rest and this was the best the only down side as i see it is that the book is rather dry then again if you expected anything other than a dry book you shouldn t be looking in non-fiction computer books humour was used but it was sarcastic and rather dry quite frankly it should have been left out completely the book was very full on presenting vast quantities of information very quickly with enough information to make things clear label trainer is an excellent supplement to any personal

program minutes color label the price was fair a interesting purchase for the sake of old time comedy television and some star power but not nearly as much johnny carson as the cover would imply this is very early carson in black and white label disappointing i found this to be a bit dull and boring the write up of the book made it sound a lot better than it truly is label shipped on time but parts are missing although the item came within days it did not come with the ac adaptor i have tried calling the customer service number located in the user guide for weeks now and no one picks up the phone i only get connected to a voice messaging system which no one has returned yet this is a christmas gift and it is very unfortunate that the gift won t be ready in time i m highly disappointed this is an expensive item and for it to not be functional is unacceptable label wonderful classics it s wonderful to see chip and dale again i just would have liked it if there were more than just three shorts luckily the ones that they included is one where they are at odds with pluto and another where they are at odds with donald duck classic label feedback the vhs i purchased doesn t work when i put it in it s black and white and is scrambled products should be tested before they are sold label no moore please thanks i quite often found the book loosing ground at times with a creative story line pulled together with odd characters it has silly humor no doubt but at times seemed like the author was stealing from theo s little garden definitely light reading for those who need a giggle or two label funny but not as good as his other stuff let me issue the disclaimer here first christopher moore is a fantastic zany and very funny author but let s face it it can t all be great lust lizard was a little too choppy even more so than practical demon keeping and sometimes the prose fell flat where it tried to be funny the characters were all well-rendered as usual but somewhere along the line my interest in some of them started to wane however the story was still good for a chuckle and general amusement on a lazy weekend remember no time is wasted on a christopher moore novel label funny and hard to put down i read this while camping and having nothing else to do which was fortunate because it was so hard to put down i love the way christopher moore writes this book is outside the box as usual just disturbing enough to be compelling without repellance funny label barely readable not only is this thing an impossible premise the style leaves one wandering about in limbo between episodic adventures the characters except for the constable are overwrought and unbelievable attempts at ironic humor are sophomoric i say this in spite of having thoroughly enjoyed both earlier books by christopher moore fool a novellamb the gospel according to biff christ s childhood pal label cindy this item is a cheap cassette player i will be buying a better one in time bulky but it does play ok the headsets are also on the cheap side i got what i paid for label worth the tape player drug my cassetes the radio was ok but i needed a cassete player-radio for my walks to the grocery store and i didn t get it in this order so i gave it away brand new i intend to purchase online another better quality walkman hopefully next month jwin jx-b32a am fm stereo cassette player with bass boost jwin jxb32a label shiping charge cassette player with bass boost jx-b32aother products by jwinno customer reviews yet be the first more about this productlist price price you save availability in stock ships from and sold by skybox-usa it seems like a waste of time searching for a shipping charge in dollars and cents even though another page shows a shipping charge in cost per pound i have no idea how much the item weighs wen packaged and shipped without a final shipping charge in dollars and cents ordering this or any other item is a gamble label excellent headphones these are a great pair of headphones for a great price its a steal definately would do business with seller again label i m surprised i m surprised at how comfortable lightweight and well put together these headphones are they put out a decent frequency response and aren t harsh at all they re well constructed and very affordable i d recommend them for the person who wants fair quality for a great price and not for the audiophile brats who are much too critical for their own ears label zero for two bought one didn t work reached the end of the timing period but wouldn t ring returned it got another same problem label you get what you pay for i ve had this timer for a while now and always had to nurse it along to get it to work by rapping it on its side after i set it also always make sure to turn past when setting it winds up the internal spring well i got tired of this procedure which worked if i was lucky about of the time it finally got tired itself and stopped working almost all the time now it really is a piece of junk as many reviewers have stated here and has been relegated to the garbage bin i don t know why i stayed with it so long save yourself the trouble and spring for a digital unit even if it s not as nostalgic label piece of junk read the description carefullyit s a mechanical timer the alarm is armed with the spring-loaded dial so the length is determined by the amount of winding you put to the dialnot very accurate and the alarm bell lasts only as much as you wind the dialits sound is very harsh and gradually dies down as the spring winds down i suppose this alarm could be good for the elderly because of its large numbers on the face and the dial label buy this for your kids and watch it yourself my wife and i took a chance after a friend saw this at a screenign and told us about it we love it as much as our kids very funny and things for kids and parents especially dads high reccommendation label nice rack sorry couldn t help myself great for hallway shoe rack getting another for the closet label guitarist baily writes brilliant and very informative book this book is absolutely essential for anyone seeking to learn more about modern music and approaching music in an historical manner baily explains the role of improvisation in a variety of music forms and in the process helps the reader attain greater knowledge and appreciation of these various genres the only section that is lacking is the one regarding rock n roll which focuses on steve howe of the band yes a rather insignificant artist in modern songwriting and rock music other than that this book is a masterpiece label the wedding dress i wish this would have a little more back bone maybe i just like longer movies if it were a little more meaty with a little longer plot it would have been a great movie instead it leaves you hanging and saying what label what a godsend i have had an estrangement from my son for the last few years i have shed many tears missing him his wife refused to allow him to see any of the members of his family no matter how many times i tried to re-connect i was rebuffed i was hurt and angry even to the extent of calling him a wimp once i read this book i realized that i was doing everything the wrong way i tried several of the author s suggestions happily i am now in touch with my son we speak on the telephone and we e-mail hopefully we will be together soon this book was a godsend label content vs sound quality the recording has a representative collection of heifitz s concert standards as well as some more obscure works even after digital remastering the poor sound quality detracts from the enjoyment of the pieces apparently the original performances were for broadcast in the s and early s it sounds like someone had a recorder in front of the radio should be of interest to collectors and music students not audiophiles the more popular pieces are available on other recordings the others seem pretty rare label a must read i don t know what the previous reviewer was talking about obviously someone with a chip on his shoulder this is an amazing story when i began this book i almost read it in one sitting i tried to prolong it for another week but when i was done i wished there was a sequel the telling of her story draws you in and makes you realize the lifestyle of a farmer is not something most people can do and the greatness of her achievements this is a book that can every one should read label remarkably bad yet mildly entertaining hell swarm is one of those films you pick up thinking you may have stumbled onto a little sleeper of a film that no one but you knows about after watching it you ll want to keep that secret to yourself for all the wrong reasons in truth there are elements of hell swarm that in the right hands and with a bit more of a budget could be developed into a decent gripping little thriller unfortunately those hands unfortunately are not tim matheson s who directs and acts in the film boyd kestner is appealing as the hero if a bit bumbling but the rest of the cast seem to have spilled over from wb shows that never aired even though there is some swearing decent violence and sensuality the entire affair feels like it was made for well the wb network or usa up all night label false adverisement this product used to be advertised as a spare uv bulb for pond clarifier but it is really not an uv bulb it costed me money and time it is not economical for me to ship it back and wish the supplier simply refund me the money without the product being returned but i doubt it since the supplier wants to make more money by false adverting the function of the product label ood stable camera i like the fact that the camera uses compact flash the compact flash cards come in sizes up to g so that is nice easy to use label disappointment what a waste of time as an avid fan of survivor i felt that the money spent was not worth it this was boring boring boring and there was no excitement whats so ever and good have gone to a fine resturant for the money spent on this garbage label was hoping for better the title of the video led me to think that it would be clips of scenes that didn t make or couldn t be shown on national tv but with few exceptions it was basically nothing more than highlights of the tv program itself to avoid nausea fast-forward through the scenes with susan in it label boring i m sorry but i did not like this book one bit although i loved mr commitment also written by mike gayle this book was nothing like mr commitment the book is a very slow read label horrible horrible horrible one day i decided i needed to read every type of book out there i usually ready fantasy novels i wanted to know if i d be interested in other books besides fantasy i picked up a horror novel and it was slightly entertaining started to read a historical fiction novel but never finished then i picked up this up i read the whole thing and decided never again to read a romance novel this guy i forget his name now but he was so pathetic and weird he wants to marry some girl from the telephone stupid but what pissed me off was the ending dumb label westlife live at wembley not realizing i ordered the pal format i could not play this dvd on my player had to send back and order one in the dvd format loved the dvd once it would play was on time as always and in great condition love amazon label they re my irish toy boys i was a total bum on new year s eve sat in front of the goggle box and watched westlife live at wembley it was fantastic definitely worth purchasing you will enjoy totally it label extremely religious and if when not very negative most of the songs on these cds are very religious so if you don t want your child to be exposed to that i would recommend looking for a different cd on top of that when there are songs that are not religious they are just absolutely horrible as an example of some of the lyrics i am squishing up the baby bumblebee i am wiping off the baby bubmlebee ouch it stung me first of all bumblebees are the most adorable and they don t sting and what are the lyrics you should have seen the monkhe sat on the elephant trunkthe elephant sneezed and fell on his kneesand that was the end of the monk seriously for little kids such lyrics what do you expect your kids to grow up if that s what they listen to label christian music whoops i somehow missed that this is a collection that includes a bunch of religious songs along with a bunch of old classics label later work by a jazz guitar legend the gypsy jazz guitar style pioneered by the much-revered django reinhardt underpins many of the best musette recordings this is some of his later work made in and when reinhardt was in a state of semi-retirement he had also become fascinated with bebop which was the universal jazz form at the time paradoxically his interest in the pyrotechnics of dizzy gillespie and charlie parker led reinhardt to play in a style which was less dynamic and more lyrical than his classic work from the s and he became a more subtly expressive player like louis armstrong in his later years reinhardt was undeniably a master musician playing with a richness and soulful depth that few musicians could hope to match sadly he died of a brain hemmorage not long after the last of these recordings in this cd set is pretty swell definitely worth checking out label flaky memory card i bought this memory card to use with my mp3 player and have found it to be very unreliable it has lost tracks that i have put on it and acted in other flaky ways like unexpectedly skipping over tracks i m looking into getting a replacement verbatim offers a lifetime warranty label one year and loving it i brought this last year from amazon during the thanksgiving blowout i was a little hesitant and was leaning more towards sony or samsung but after reading the reviews and comparing the models at bestbuy went ahead and bought it i had absolutely no problem with it in the one year i had it except for one pixel in the screen that went bad recommended label beatiful i love my new tv the colors are vivid the image quality is pretty good even when it s not in hd channels besides i think is stylish looks great in my living room label al4rfun we have two other sharp lcd tvs so i researched various lcd tvs online for a birthday gift for my husbandand and i kept coming back to the toshiba hl67u i couldn t find a better deal for the features and price we ve had the tv for three weeks now and i love it my husband on the other hand is still not sure if he likes it because he really wanted the sharp inch but i think he is seeing that this tv has everything that he would have gotten in a sharp without the higher cost the only negative i have is that there is a delayed response when turning the tv on maybe about a second delay update this tv stop working after months so i would not recommend a toshiba to anyone ever to repair cost more that we were will to pay because there was no guarantee that this wouldn t happen again stick with sharp or sony label beware panel dies after almost years rip off like others i have owned my hl67u for almost years loved it picture great and enjoyed it now a piece of junk i compared my problem to others and have concluded i need to replace it screen nor menus appear when i turn on i turned it off and unplugged the inputs to no avail dead tv pissed off last toshiba for me label broke after months i bought this television because of the good reviews after about months the screen started going blank i would turn it off and back on and the picture would come back finally it went completely blank and never would re appear i took it to a service center and am waiting to get it back i never thought the picture quality was that good except on hd programs label broke after months we had our tv three months before it broke it started turning on and off on its own until it just wouldn t turn on again we gave the tv to the service center authorized by toshiba who told us the part they needed was back-ordered at toshiba over two weeks later we re still in the queue to have toshiba simply look for the part with no guarantees as to if or when they ll find it we ve had to make multiple phone calls just to get toshiba to do anything at all and we ve had to act as the middle man between the authorized service center and toshiba i definitely won t be buying another toshiba tv after this experience label beautiful this tv is great picture quality is awesome i also have a p projection of another brand picture quality in both is so close you wouldn t know the difference but the richness in the color of the lcd is unmatched label toshiba lcd tv looks great priced right however delivery was a hassel took to long almost weeks but once i made contact with shipper which you must do doesn t say that any where things went smoother label great canera maybe more than enough for some using the camera in the auto mode takes nice pictures basically point and shoot very nice for the begginers the maual mode is where you will get it s best however use of the manual mode will take little more understanding in basic operation of camera what is minimum or basic personally ex you should atleast know what the shuttle speed and amperature is if not you still can study but if not planning on professional use consider somthing cheaper i bought this and love it i am not a pro photographer but have basic experience plus i love challenge learning so far the only complaint is the multi controller which is hard to select the battery was ok for me i dont think ill get an extra go to local electronics store and try it out conclusion have the money like new challenge great pictures buy it i dont have bit of regret but thats me label great photos and user friendly i searched compared and waited for the technology to be put in a small compact package this camera has a lot of excellent automatic and manual features for taking great night and day photos with excellent color it also has a second movie option with sound that is a lot of fun i like the fact that i can plug right into the television to view photos and movie clips the software is also nice i would recommend buying an extra battery and much larger compact flash card label disappointing this plunger must only work on certain types of toilets because i couldn t get an airtight seal at least not with the larger attachment however i discovered that the smaller attachment meant for sinks and whatnot did help a bit to at least drain the toilet but not clear the clog i can recommend this for sinks and other drains but not for toilets at least not my toilet label excellent movie love the old movies we have walked out of almost every movie we have attended in the last years label fake jersey if you are looking for the real reebok replica jersey distributed by the nfl this is not it this is a fake jersey with cheap embroidery whereas the originals are screen printed it is the wrong color blue and is made of cheap material don t waste your money label not that great i just could not get into this book it was all over the place book did not really get good to me until the last few chapters label disappointing ending the ending was so disappointing it seemed so rushed was not as suspenseful as the whole novel i liked it for the most part because it is very vivid creative different but the ending just ruined it label too much talk not enough action in the words of paul revere and the raiders this book has too much talk and not enough action would have made a good edited short story to many conversations where the characters repeat themselves got bored with this label rally spell binding book i have read almost all her books and each one is a spellbinding it is really hard to put down label very dissapointed there wasn t much to this book at all i was very dissapointed in it did not find helpfull at all label horrible acting and plot undeveloped and corny characters acted by horrible actors i wish the philippine movie industry would shape-up and produce high quality movies label lost weight but horrible side effects i started taking this last friday as directed on the package two caplets three times a day the first day i felt really sick to my stomach and really bloated and gassy i also had diarrhea it was also difficult to sleep the second day the gassiness was still there but not as bad but i started to get really bad dizzy spells the third day it was the same thing but i woke up with three huge pimples on my face not normal little pimples these are enormous and very painful i decided to continue as i was losing weight but i took only one caplet three times a day so cut my dosage in half the fourth day i found another huge pimple on my neck and decided to stop taking the drug i lost pounds in the three days i took it but seriously i would rather just diet and exercise more than deal with the acne and bloated feeling i did feel more calm and relaxed but again the side effects aren t worth it to me label hair loss yeah for all of you people keep taking the product you may experience the same results as i am now after taking relacore fore few weeks my hair started to fall out it happened like over night the first day i lost two hand fulls of hair i used to have long thick hair now my hair is thin and you can see my scalp not only that it keeps falling out more so i am years old and i am going bald read the label it says hair loss be careful and stop talking it before its too late i called customer service they telling me to send back the pills and they will give me my money back i don t care about that i wanted to contact someone who knows if my hair will ever grow back i was told that the hair loss side effect is written there just in case that people never that these side effects i went online read customer reviews and i am not the only one who is losing hair some other side effects fatigue stomach cramps drowsiness not able to concentrate acme dry scalp label best metal album of this is not only the best metal cd of but could be the best comeback album ever this could be exodus s best cd get this it shreds i love it every metal collection needs this cd will go down as a classic label misleading this is not a live album but studio tracks dubbed with a fake live audience no wonder this product has been discontinued the engineers did a poor job of dubbing the so called live audience label poor quality product having taught french and spanish prior to my retirement i know what to look for in teaching a foreign language this course is probably the poorest quality i have yet to see lesson begins by giving you a few basic words in turkish in rapid succession then goe to chapter six which is quite advanced all in lesson no time is given to practice the pronunciation before moving on to the next word or phrase don t waste your money label could not put it down this book as been in print for some time but that does not in any way at all diminish it s impact for a new reader this is a searing powerful book full of amazing prose intense characters and a darkly beautiful storyline alexander has a fantastic quality to his writing and the fact that this book apparently won the whitbread but was stripped due to it s content makes it all the more compelling enjoy label reminded me of creative writing class back in the day how this book received much acclaim is beyond me perhaps because of the hoopla surrounding the whitbread prize it s not so much that the subject matter is distasteful which it is but so was lolita and that was a damn good book but the story line plods along i did lots of skim reading and don t think i missed much and jessie s motivations in the end are ridiculous the only thing that kept me going was my desire to know how her brain worked however warped that never happened a friend moving overseas gave me all her books this one included thank god i didn t spend money on it not worth a cent label great book by a great teacher i m writing to recommend a unique book from one of my teachers that has just been published it is called learning to read midrash and helps provide you with a basic methodology for accessing midrashic literature the author simi peters is a gifted teacher and writer who draws on traditional and academic sources to really bring the material alive her class at my yeshiva last year nishmat first thing on sunday mornings has been one of the highlights of my learning here in israel label had to watch watching the avengers which i purchased gave me an appetite for more of the black widow this was good but i rented it label iron man we bought it from amazon com it is a great movie on blu ray arrived exactly when it was suppose to on the first day on the market i was so excited almost as good as iron man the original movie label better than the first great movie interesting story line great effects i think it might be better than the first label sequels rarely turn out well i think actors get too excited confident if the original movie does well and decide they want to put on a really good show the next time or maybe it s the director because everything in this movie fails the acting and special effects were well over done so disappointing downey rourke and cheadle are three of my favorite actors hopefully this isn t the end label great followup to excellent first movie couldn t pass up buying this movie when it was dirt cheap at iron man is one of my sons favorite action stars and he watches the first two movies over and over i like the overall story think it was a great follow up to first movie and cant wait for the next one due out label big letdown i can t add anything that hasn t been already stated the scene where the ironman suit gets stolen by somebody who has never stepped inside of one before made me cringe the scenario is so typical now sequels to blockbuster s are just half-assed thrown together because they know theye are gonna make money regardless at least it was only wasted nf rental for me label item didn t play not only did the disk not work it is now stuck inside my player i have to take my player to a repair shop and pay to have the disk removed label great for year old boys adults kind of boring very little charachter development and very obvious speical effects a no go great for year old boys adults kind of boring very little charachter development and very obvious speical effects a no go label awesome movie love the iron man movies liked it great br and includes the dvd and digital copy for itunes what else can you ask for great value and awesome movie can t wait for the next one to come out label an amazing time although i was in my teens at the end of the s i still managed to get an idea of how fast or slow gay liberation was happening before the scourge arrived gay sex in the s reminds me strongly of that time it s difficult to comprehend now how dichotomous were the times widespread homophobia and oppression coupled with a flowering queer expression er yeah just like now except it was a whole lot more innocent this album is a compilation of those first expressions of joy and liberation and if you can get past the dated sound is a great listen label as men grow this is a book about how men grow men don t often look at themselves and their growth they just age this book adds meaning and touch points to this process label horrible sound i m a great fan of julio iglesias but this dvd should never have been released with an absolutely apalling sound quality as well as a poor selection of songs i m totally amazed any producer would put such poor sound quality on a dvd label gold chain i wore this for days and it turned black i threw it away i dont believe it was advertised correctly but then again you get what you pay for i will be getting my jewelry in person from now on label interesting but disappointing as a fan of the smiths i couldn t resist buying this tribute some of the songs are interesting but i have to say that most are not worth listening my wife who is even a bigger smiths fan couldn t even sit through most of the songs well we are just disappointed with this album label the best i dont know what the others are talking about i recieved this as a gift about years ago the only reason i dont still have it is because someone stole it about years ago i have been looking for this exact one ever since so glad i finally found it again this is the best cd shower radio ever got it really wet often with out any problems gets great reception quality of sound is great batteries last a very long time and i used it everyday great for taking to the beach also total win can t wait for it to arrive so i can start using it again i have bought others over the last few years and they all were terrible this is the one thanks label eh it s does the job but we got this to keep our older son in track to finish his homework unfortuantely the quality is not that great and it s not that loud when the alarm rings my daughter accidently dropped it from the table to the floor and the front plastic cover came off also the back metal stand stopped staying in place after awhile there are others that are much better you get what you pay for this was cheap and so it was live and learn label can t hear timer the timer pitch is way to high i can only hear it when it is against my ear my dog can hear it just fine label junk lasted two cycles before lcd row burned out i thought it was just the battery but the entire nd horizontal row burned out making it unreadable within minutes of using literally minutes use and its junk needs a reset button to reset time need to pause then hit m and s together rather flimsy device if i didnt throw away the packaging i would have returned it to the store although driving it back would cost as much in gas burn up an hour of my day made in china i should have learned by now label works but no on off switch button the timer works and has a memory feature but there is no way to turn it off when you are finished you have take out the battery to keep from draining the battery down quite useless to keep up with the battery when not in use label cheaply made dead on arrival the timer was very light and apparently cheaply made it was dead on arrival out of the box label perfect exactly what i wanted i previously had this very same timer for more than years and when it broke i was delighted to find i could purchase the exact same model label the worst timer on the market absolute junk i actually bought this timer from target a couple days ago and it was the worst piece of junk i have bought in a long time it took me about minutes to get it up and running you have to use a screwdriver to remove the back panel and then the battery housing doesn t align with the spring that keeps the battery in place normally the spring is inside the battery housing but not with this version it s too difficult to explain how the pieces fit together but it took me or minutes just to get the battery in place and then once i reassembled the thing and twisted the screws back into place the back panel of the device wasn t applying enough pressure to the battery and it would slip out of place and go dead i m just glad i held onto my receipt coz i intend to return this junk and try to convince the store manager to stop carrying the taylor brand label too cheap bought one at targe and upon opening it and trying it out realized i d wasted my money loose attacment of magnet means you can t use it while on the fridge beep is very weak too soft to be heard if anything else is going on in a word useless when will someone make one with a big magnet that will never fall off in use label clock problems right from the beginning we had a problem the first night we set the clock to the correct time and then programmed the machine to start brewing at am the next morning when i checked the machine at am the brewing had not started because the clock now read am ok so maybe it got bumped one design problem is it s really easy to bump the clock buttons but it would have had to have been bumped times so i reset the clock and pushed the on button to start brewing right away no big deal that afternoon at about pm i decided to go program the machine to brew a pot about pm or so but once again i find the clock is exactly hours behind again long story short don t trust the clock which also means it is useless to program the machine and expect a steaming pot of coffee when you wake up label security hazard one replaced after two months not heating anymore another one which died one year later not heating anymore too it was a good opportunity to notice that the bottom base was damaged by normal use and that potentially coffee could be in contact with the wires in the base a colleague of mine told me she had the same issue at home damaged base this could set a fire the clock is perfect the coffee was ok crappy model black and decker should test properly its products label noble flop this cd was not what i expected considering the musicians on the cd one big bomb but the purpose behind the cd was noble label not worth ordering very light weight and the non-stick surface does not work well spend more and go for a better skillet label farberware classic inch nonstick deep skillet farberware classic inch nonstick deep skilletthis product was not what it appeared to be it is very cheaply made i also ordered the lid which didn t fit onto the pan i had this shipped to my daughter in ct and they threw away all the packing receipts or i would have returned it horrible label despicabale not only did he exploit a child but he exploited an entire culture as well as his students i wish all the students at njcu would boycott his class he is a self-centered egotistical unethical selfish human being he should be ashamed of his actions i don t want to write more even though i could go on because i know he reads this personally and it will only feed into his huge ego even more pathetic label underratted by a star i first read this book ten years ago and it is still my favorite the concept of death playing a trivia machine and war being a foreign correspondent is too humorous for words the contest for the affections of the antichrist by the regional managers of heaven and hell is also a delightful absurdity label divine and beautiful well it s as funny as everyone says i read it and re-read it and seven years later i m still finding new jokes and only yesterday did i finally understand the ending i m ashamed to admit it made me cry with happiness or possibly hysteria the astonishing amount of in-jokes and cultural references from queen to yeats make it absorbing reading and the morals and ideas crammed haphazardly in make it something of a classic the prose is skillful and pretty but what i enjoyed most about this book was its warmth and humanity the characters are simply delicious and i defy anyone not to fall in love with crowley and aziraphale who are adorable seperately and perfect together in the end i found the book simply uplifting i m afraid i flatly disagree with those who found the ending a disappointment bittersweet hilarious powerful and poignant very very human it s ineffable dear boy don t you know label great read since neverwhere i have been a huge neil gaiman fan i really enjoy his writing style and this one was excellent a lady at the bookstore recommended this book to me and i was definitely not disappointed it s a very strange tale but also funny and intellectually intriguing excellent novel label good omens is just plain good fun it is in england eleven years before the apocalypse when the demon crowley s worst fear is realized he receives a summons from hell to pick up the anti-christ and deliver the infant to a human family the only problem is crowley likes the world and doesn t want it destroyed and so he enlists the help of his long-time rival the angel aziraphale and the two set off to save humankind pratchett and gaiman deliver an exquisitely crafted novel and a hilarious and poignant examination of the most complex character of allhuman nature consider yourself warnedthis book will have you laughing to yourself in the middle of the night and when you ve turned the last pageleave you thinking label frustrating wild romp to nowhere i love neil gaiman i love terry pratchett i hate good omens in a frustrated attempt to read the book cover to cover i was twarted many times by books that were much funnier more pleasant to read and more comprehendable anyone by goodkind or all other gaiman pratchett books jordon adams this book did not make sense was a half hearted attempt at low brow humor which unfortunately did not work and why read this if you can spend your time elsewhere it s a good omen you read this review before thinking about buying the book don t waste your time or money like i did label so disappointed i purchased this book after seeing it mentioned more than a few times as one of the funniest books people had ever read i consider myself to have a pretty decent sense of humor and love british wit so really looked forward to this one read to page had not had more than one tiny snicker and gave up this book will go into work into our free for the taking bookshelf where we trade off paperbacks label almost like pulling teeth although not quite as enjoyable i actually purchased this book by reading the online reviews on amazon i should have heeded the warnings about boredom this book is a mish mash hodge podge and any other cliche you care to throw in there the authors struggle to emulate the adam s humor but only succeed in wasting the readers time overly verbose and dry i found myself skipping long chunks of dialogue just to get to the ending label love gaiman but this was the worst book i ve read in a long time i am a true gaiman fan but i do not feel that this book was a good one it was too light for me i was so annoyed by the lack of plot and the fact that the plot there was didn t make any sense that i did not even laugh once at the funny notations on every page this book was one of the worst ones i have read in a long time and it pains me to say this about gaiman but it is the truth if you are really drawn to purchase this bookdo yourself a favor and read a chapter before purchase you ll be glad you did this book was terrible if this was really genius then it is totally over my head and i am totally unaware of it i kept reading it instead of putting it down because it was gaiman and i kept thinking it has to be worth it in the end much to my dismay it was not it was horrible the entire way through label what was god really thinking yeah it s hilarious and yeah comparisons to hitchhiker sguide are inevitable but well look forget who wrotethe bible because this is it the first chapter says itall the humor is excellent and the theme of the realitybehind the supposed war between heaven and hell is one thatgaiman has explored more than once it s reminiscent of sandman season of mists and the short story murdermysteries from the collection angels and visitations this is an ideal partnership and one that i for one applaud label fantastic read what a ripper smart sassy funny clever in fact all of the things you would expect from a neil gaiman book label skip it first i ve only read about pages of this book so perhaps it has some dramatic improvements i m missing but overall it isn t very clever and it s rather uninteresting there are pages of setup for jokes that fall flat it s british so you may have trouble if you re american and don t know some british slang tubes are subways etc i have a pretty eclectic sense of humor and this book didn t appeal to any of the wide-ranging aspects of humor i appreciate irony sarcasm wacky stuff satire wit this had none worth mentioning label there s a god above a devil below and they teamd up what can be said that haven t been already only once or twice in a life time do we get these kind of writers this time both of them created this master piece together between complex hilarious lies the quirky and all of them behave like one happy family of serial killers every character you meet is someone you already met wished you d meet woke up in the middle of the night drenched in cold sweat just from dreaming about meeting them from the nutty beginning to the although endlessly hinted upon in the book then misunderstood surprising ending you hold on alternately to the edge of your chair stomach let us join in prayer for a sequel although any other team up of those two will make my day year read it again again again again label corrupted kripke in this book the work of kripke is victim of a simple and irrelevant interpretation the writing is coarse and lacks the indispensable level if your are interested in philosophy of the language looks for another book label for the batteries talk about a waste of money for the two button batteries at the local rite aid then you almost need to have a jeweler to change the silly things the screws you need to remove the batteries are very small and unless you have excellent vision you will need a magnifying glass and a pair of tweezers to put the screws back one of the screws holds the fragile battery contact in place i will never ever buy another timer that uses these expensive batteries for the timer and for the batteries dumb label not for the professional kitchen we ve chewed through several of these timers at our restaurant they just don t hold up to heavy use here is a summary of issues we ve had screen blanks out alarm fails to go off when times runs out alarm chirps randomly and incessantly this one was broken in half before being thrown away the buttons get easily gummed up and stick plus there is no easy way to change the battery i m assuming you have to remove the tiny screws in the back but we ve never had one last long enough for the battery to run out label taylor timer great kitchen timer very nice large easy to see numbers with loud easy to hear beeper nice magnetic backing that adheres well to my range hood where it is easy to see and use this is my second one and i love it it is so easy to use one button one finger operation amazon delivered quickly and at the best price label decent design poor execution i was looking for a timer with a keypad for entering digits instead of up and down arrows and i chose this one unfortunately the buttons do not work consistently pressing a button can result in zero one or two digits the outcome appears to be random for example you can press and hoping for seconds and end up with minutes or minutes and seconds replacement batteries cost as much as the timer itself i would not buy this timer again label terrible timer i have used several timers and use them throughout the day almost every day i bought four of these because they were inexpensive i was disappointed to find that the last time set does not reset when the timer signal sounds a feature that other timers have also the signal gets scratchy or static-y at times one of the magnets fell off the back of one and the stands have two positions one of which they don t remain in very well overall i am disappointed and will not purchase these again i think pampered chef makes the best timer but was looking for something more reasonably priced especially since my children use them as well label no refunds with this product i tried writing a review on this product and it did not pass the approval process to be displayed by amazon customers why i have reviewed many products without being rejected i was not cursing or saying bad things about this vendor just the truth i would give this vendor a rating of if possible let s see if amazon would let a low review be seen by amazon customers will not buy from this vendor ever label installing on mac os with parralel desktop hi does it work for installing microsoft windows vista home basic upgrade dvd on new macbook pro after installing a parralel desktop please advisewith many thanks label this is a disappointing timer this timer is a disappointment a key feature of a count-down timer is the alarm the alarm on the is inaudible beyond feet say you set the time for one hour and then do something else at the end of the hour you cannot hear the alarm go off so you do not know that the time is up another poor feature is that the timer can be set for either hours and minutes or for minutes and seconds it cannot be set for hours minutes and seconds i intend to look for a better kitchen timer label life in the nd airborne in wwii one hears alot about the airborne screaming eagles especially after ambrose s books on the subject i liked this book and got a better look at what life was like in the nd you get sad when the author talks about the bodies the author comes across huertegen forest when the author comes across this battlefield so many died for our country and those that endured this agony didn t have it much better this is a nice memoir of the author s role in wwii i got a better glimpse of what life was like in the nd the author portrays how it was in both combat and rear areas he talkes of his loss of friends and comrades in battle he also talks about his early poverty and why he joined the army an interesting story from a patriot label descending to boredom i wish i could recommend this book because mr wurst undoubtedly has an interesting story to tell he just didn t tell it well it lacks specifics and fails to draw you into his story reading much like pages from a diary too dry too general too boring if this book were a parachute it would fail to open label this thing is great i just bought this earlier today i have burned dvd-r s with no trouble i have only been able to burn at x because that is the max on my media i am very satisfied so far it installed easy and it came with a great software package i would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a top of the line dvd burner label waste of money waste of money not it sounds muffled in a system buyers beware i do not recommend should have to advertise bit rate label bloated broken and bilious worst os i have ever seen in years does not function even on factory installs unbelievably slow and non user friendly wireless and wired connections will not start will not retain settings and disconnects randomly if doing an upgrade buy a new hard drive remove your old one and set it on a shelf if you have any problems with the install you can put the old hard drive in and continue working crashed intalls can wipe out everything and it can take weeks to get everything running requires up to gigs of hard drive space label vista will not network with xp i just bought a new sony notebook for my son who is going to college in september vista home premium was pre installed on the sony plugged it into my home network whidh has xp machines on it the xp machines network fine the vista machine does not see the xp machine and the xp machines do not see the vista after an hour and minutes on the phone with sony they announced that they do not deal with network issues minutes on the pnone with linksys and they told me the issue was not related to network equipment microsoft charged me for support i was on the phone with them for over hours i went through levels of support the first two from india the third level was from the us but seemed genuinely puzzled my advice is do not buy vista if you have any plan of networking your visat machine with an xp machine label a huge step backwards microsoft has really missed the mark and has taken a huge step backwards with this latest operating system i have had a retail version of windows vista sitting on my desk uninstalled for almost months now meanwhile my computer is stilling running windows xp and it s going to stay that way for some time to come windows vista is slower buggier and less productive than windows xp regardless the hardware you use on it label billy pay me plenty of grandfathers could tell the same story yet nobody is giving them a publishing deal another in the line of celebrity books at least jay leno s new book was funny label perfect gift for a grandpa to be this book is absolutely adorable while it was written from the perspective of a dad to his pregnant with girl daughter the sentiments are truly lovely label wonderful game i think that capcom did an excellent job creating this game the graphics are stellar and the storyline is great it keeps your attention and you definitely have to use brainpower to figure out the best way to have zack complete the task this game was definitely slept on by a lot of people but i hope that they create a sequel this is one of those games that you can play over and over again label life is what it looks like at first glance nice movie about corrupt politicians whether they be democrat republican or green party a good case for term limits nice to see a movie about old school schools and about how well meaning teachers who want to give promising but failing students an extra boost at other more deserving student s expense if anyone learns a lesson in this movie it is the teacher who learns that bad boys grow up to be bad men and smart forgiving boys grow up to be smart forgiving men label what i can t believe all of the good reviews this film is receiving it is manipulative cliched and formulaic kline does not give a performance of his caliber the direction is shoddy and the writing preposterous i can t believe reviewers on here like the movie as much as they do i thought it was just awful label horrible movie if you view this movie within the world of mr hundert kevin klein and and his view on life as a teacher you should appreciate this movie more then i have i instead gave it a perspective from judging the maturity and psychological development of all the characters throughout the storyline and as a result found it disgustingly random and inconseqential the only real character in the movie was mr hundert the other figures in the story have a simplistic one-sided personality to augment the movies only apparant conflict of intergirty vs corruption remember if you ever do see it concentrate on kevin klein and no one else label craftsmanship issues main clock is not synched with projection clock those are actually set separatelybroke within a few weeks label very dissappointed the clock is one hour behind every hours which can not be called inaccurate this is like a joke the projection s clock is accurate but as you can not see it in daylight it doesn t help much if you are thinking about buying this product think again don t let the low price fool you it is not worth it label another great lonely planet edition i used this book for my trip to western europe last year overall you just cannot beat lonely planet travel guide books i ended up staying at many hotels that were mentioned in the book the maps are great it is a pretty big book to haul around in your backpack but i would rather have a big book with valuable content than a smaller book without good information label unknow world in the ant world there s an ant scout that came back with an unknown crystal from a far away place the queen of the ant colony damands the ants get more crystals a group of ants set off to find more crystals the ants end up in an unusual world this book was fun and exciting because of the danger the ants were in by dontre and derrick label beautiful i am one of those people that keeps their jewelry on always rings wrist cuff necklace earrings and watch so i knew i wanted a blue by fossil because they are waterproof to meters i actually bought this from the fossil site for with the year warranty however that one somehow got fogged up on the inside so i had to have it replaced the new one s mop was not quite so beautifully colored but after wearing this watch almost every single day for over a year i still get random compliments i have lost crystals now though it isn t noticed to anyone unless i point it out today i met another woman with the same watch except her face is white and we both gushed at how much we loved it label a book for beginners and non-artists if you are looking for a book with lots of ideas and inspiration for working in polymer clay this is not the one to buy the first half of the book is devoted to techniques and would be helpful for the first time clay user though there are very few photos to guide you the projects in the second half are of the craft variety a picture frame jewelry box etc they would be great for beginners but not very challenging or interesting for experienced artists i returned this book within a half hour of receiving it label thanks great service great communication product as described arrived on time all components would do business with this company again label review this is a great book and i recommend it lots of action and it takes you through a roller coaster of different like hilarious jeolusy humiliation and especially revenge label altered soundtrack i anxiously bought this release only to find that someone though the films would be better if new music was added to the soundtrack the case says it has the original audio but it doesn t say that music has been added thank goodness i was able to exchnage this disc for something else why can t they leave things alone label not remastered hallmark owns the rights to the laurel and hardy sound films they do not care about using the best available prints the kirch group in england only used the best available mm originals for their laurel and hardy dvds we in america get a dvd with added modern sounding music and a tv print not the original masters hallmark does not care and will not respond to emails i will not buy anything by hallmark or artisan until they get it right hallmark will not sell the rights to people who really would do something for the preservation and restoration of these films these films have never been remastered in america a very angry fan label suzy comes through the last edition of born to shop disappointed me becasue suzy gershman s interest seemed so narrow that the stores and places she liked were too far out of my range in this edition she s made some changes cheap shopping is listed and the luxe nowhere else except nyc stores are listed as well she must have gotten some younger helpers because much to my delight the sean jean store and and triple five soul shop are mentioned too one thing i ve always liked about the born to shop series is that the advice shows you how to get around town safely how to buy quality and how to have a good time with as few hassles as possible and don t think this book is just for women in our last trip to ny my husband frequently consulted it and was very pleased with the directions and commentary this book and gerry frank s guide are all you really need to take a weekend nyc trip label you won t learn how to be a stand up comic reading this book while reading this book is mildly amusing you will not learn how to construct a joke or bring out your funny side by reading it in short you won t learn much about how to be a stand up comedian i was disappointed because i do think belz is a funny guy i just didn t think the book was very instructive label had to return them the loops don t fit on all reformers i have a pilates power gym and the loops did not reach all the way ended up returning which was a hassle because schott pilates is in canada so it cost me to ship back amazon will not deal with return you have to go straight to the manufacturer overall the loops are well made but my experience was a headache label don t try this album at home needless to say his playing is nothing spectacular his fusion experiment lyrically blew up in his face this is an overratted album that i would not recommend to any jazz lover on the left hand his tales from the hudson is a good modern era album his flawless technique and great sidesmen keep the album flowin label the best of the dmc series this game is way better than the other games in every way if you were a fan of the other games then you will definately love this game the graphics are better and the controls though they vechanged a little bit are easy to get used to the biggest downfall the game has is that you do not start out playing as dante but some new kid named nero however once you start playing as nero you ll find out just how cool he is too in some of the gaming mags i ve read the reviewers liked playing nero more than dante i personally like playing dante more but hey nero is still very cool the only other thing left to say about the game is that it s a true dmc game the story and attitude of the characters are all there the beautiful women and strange demons are in the game too if you own a ps3 then buy this game if you are getting a ps3 then get this game if you own a xbox then this is the only good game you can play label a little stiff i ordered this bedroom set because my son loves anything truck related i wanted to get him interested in his new big boy toddler bed it worked he likes the trucks on the sheets and will point them out and name them however the sheets are a little rough the comforter itself is very cute but also rough and stiff i m hoping that if i keep washing it it will soften up it s just one of those blankets that when you put it over someone it stays in the same shape until you bring it closer to you at this point my son uses a different blanket when he goes to bed one that is much softer and lays over him completely with out creating little air vents i love the look of the set but was disapointed with the quality of it maybe it ll get better with washing label a trip back to my past one of my favorite books and i also loved the movie i have been wanting this fine portrayal of the book s charactors for so long and consider myself lucky to have found it on dvd the acting is such that i can watch it over and over and probably will the transaction was troube free which is a compliment to the seller thank you label well it s different keeping an open mind i was prepared to read an objective work on modern day cults which oddly enough include almost every world religion what i found was a completely biased mean-spirited jab at every belief system that didn t smack of hard-core christianity no one but the most rabid christian could possibly find this book interesting enlightening or even entertaining it is an insult that a baptist minister chooses to wield immaturity and prideful judgement as a weapon against others his uneducated ramblings are honestly not worth the time and labor used to print this book consider this work just another incarnation of bible belt trash label an authoritarian on cults and other religions if you are truly a seeker of the truth this is a book that must be in your library have you ever wanted to know why the seventh day adevtise church is the way it is or have you wanted to always know how islam mormons or jehovah witnesses got their start everything in walter martin s book is based upon hard facts found in magazines court cases and documented sources this book will open your eyes and make you realize the fabrications that many cults and religions have painstaikingly gone through to create the illusion of what is the truth walter martin s kingdom of the cults opens these falsehoods to the light of day and it gives christians the tools to have intelligent and rational discussions with a person who believes one of these ruses it is a tantamount book resourceful direct and above all it is the truth label kingdom of the cults excellent and informative book i was a bit surprised to see that the seventh day adventists are no longer considered a cult in spite of the fact that i know they still are very much focused on the teaching of ellen g white label you too might be a cultist if you re not a fundie how are we supposed to tke a book seriously that lumps islam a major world religion that inculdes nearly of the world s population in with small fringe groups like the moonies it is simply a fact that the world cult is only appropriate when used to denote groups that are small extremely authoritarian i e centered around a strong leader with unchecked power over the members and outside the maintream of any major tradition a world religion is by definition not a cult niether is a well established liberal protestant denomination like the unitarian church a cult if any group that is not conservative protestant is a cult which seem to be martin s basic premise then why doesn t he call judaism catholicism and eastern orthodoxy cults it would be pretty ridiculous but it wouldn t make this book any less logical label sound and informative for anyone wanting to know what their friends acquaintances co-workers who are involved in any of these cults believe and why this is a clear and informative it presents the obvious cults of today and the not so obvious provides origination and history of each cult and the basics of what they believe then it gives a comparison to what the bible teaches and how each cult contradicts what the word is saying very helpful for me in understanding where people i know are coming from label modern mob adventure this is really an underrated film about a group of criminals working in los angeles the story involves strong loyalty among gang members but also betrayal and greed by one of its members some of the scenes are raw and gripping and the police are not always angels los angeles comes alive as the focal point for this film and it s engaging to consider the way criminals devise schemes to rob from the rich and then become emulators of the wealthy label nice looking magazine rack overall it s a nice looking magazine rack it s not solid wood as i expected it s the type of wood you would expect to see on target furniture the metal hardware also broke for me as it did in the other user s review but luckily i had another one on hand those parts just aren t very reliable the price may be a bit high but i was unable to find a style that i liked as much as this one overall i am pleased with it and it is doing a good job holding all my magazines label coast to coast fiasco arthur please leave florida to the likes of carl hiaasen or elmore leonard your novel failed short in its depiction of our favorite state the cast of characters wasn t excessively long but the individual storylines were poorly developed all the coincidences the fbi agent who falls for the car-collector woman who sells her red jaguar to the parents of the teenage bank robber who killed a senator with an asthma attack the vicious and beautiful killer her lovely parents her psychic blind daughter how forced and convoluted i prefer simpler novels this is not it label alaskan buyers discrimated against again this order clearly stated it could be shipped to the u s only which alaska is part of when they want our oil it did not say continental u s only the vendor decided that alaska did not apply and cancelled the order which was a gift for a loved one which of course did not arrive as scheduled clearly this could have shipped united states postal if the vendor was concerned for the customer but in this case it was cancelled after taking their time as well i would not use any vendor other than amazon direct they have never pulled this on me after many many orders sent to alaska beware of this vendor label wth recieved the package in a good enough time but the issue was that disc was missing in it s place was agent cody banks which leads me to believe that it was done intentionally emailed the seller twice in hopes to just get the third disc sent out sent my hubby had no issue w the other discs but seller never responded forced to file a claim to get my money back highly dissapointed w the service dissapointed hubby who of course really wants to watch disc it was the most important disc to him he doesn t have it buyer be ware i will never buy from this seller again label just one complaint this game has greatly improved from its previous installments but there is one thing that continues to annoy me that is the repetitive game play the enemies do change quite a bit but you run into similar enemies way more often than you should in my opinion but the graphics are great all the way around the new styles and weapons are very fun in every way also the story is interesting more so than any of the previous dmc games i would recommend this game for anyone who wants to enjoy devil may cry one last time at its peak this game is worth a look label don t buy this product many of the reviews here are accurate and valuable the most important piece of advice is to contact linksys and see if your printer is supported having set the environment up with my hp officejet k60 everything seems fine when i go to print however the application recognizes the printer and even knows what port it is connected on unfortunately everything i print goes into a black hole after calling linksys support they tell me that looking through their internal list it shows a number of poor people like myself who have tried and failed to get the k60 working so they assume its not supported when i asked if i could get a copy of the list indicating what is supported i was told its an internal only document so its trial and error if you have this product like other reviews they recommended that i upgrade to the wps11 server although i ve been happy with linksys i think i ll look elsewhere first label lots of good ideas for those moving to the healthy raw vegan diet but stumped about what to make for dinner besides salad this book contains many great ideas i was taken by the variety and inventiveness of many of the recipes where various ingredients are combined in very clever ways in order to get not only the flavour but also the correct texture i particularly like the recipes for raw lasagna sushi and dolmas these are great for surprising the non-raw with the possibilities of food in its natural state the book itself can inspire the non-raw with its professional layout and superb photography the additional information on how to prepare items such as rejuvelac and cashew cheese are straight forward and easy to follow well worth the money label very convenient and easy to use this is a good one large buttons help operate easily size of numbers is about inch for each time display the audible alert is pleasant to hear loud enough for within the room use or nearby i read the previous reviews and bought this one i use it for timing practice tests for my kids easy directions and pretty sturdy i use it on a table top so i have no idea how strong the magent is worth the money label do not buy horrible product buttons are too hard to push or ultra-sensitive where the slightest rub and you have triggered something the display is covered in grime on the inside so that you cannot see the numbers very well a really garbage product label wow what a read this is the first book i have bought on the american civil war i could not put it down once started its an easy read with a well written introduction that puts the reader in the correct state on mind before commencing the book label father now grandfather memorized this book reading it to our four children as they grew up and am now giving copies to them for their children it s a classic label good story i only gave this a five star because of the way she ended the story it leaves you hanging you don t know if she was able to stop her mother from doing this to another little girl otherwise the book was good it amazes me what some mothers do to their own children and yet they get away with it label nds lite stand i ve been waiting for this for a while it s a great idea my shoulders and hands are less sore it offers a lot of different angles for your viewing it offers for both left and right handed players and it even stands vertically for nds crosswords game i would recommend this to anybody with the ds lite console label true value reminiscing about past camping days was made possible with a carefully cared for second hand edition of this book that brought enjoyment to a small camp reunion this fall label good lord people can publish anything robert thinks that just because he reads something he can spit it back out this book by an expert is putrid the care described would be considered abuse by most varanid enthusiasts not to mention there are many mislabeled photos etc i am shocked this got published it really shows how ignorant the general public is about reptiles they seem to just accept the information because it is published by a phd reading this and considering it good is like reading a children s book about a construction company and trying to builda house with it completely wacky info everything mislabeled a recipe for disaster get daniel s fantastic savannah monitor book instead label faith food a faith-builder i have really enjoyed faith food it has strengthened my faith and is a great start to the day i have bought over copies for friends and family kenneth e hagin s simplicity in believing the bible is so refreshing and brings me back to god s promises and his faithfulness i highly recommend it tom squashic pastor label it does what it s supposed to i ve read some of the reviews about this product and the biggest complaint seems to be that the head sometimes gets water on the garment i only get spots when i try and use it on something laid flat because the water condenses in the head it will also condense in the hose and if the hose drops below the steamer it gurgles this really is not a tabletop item it has to be used on the floor i ve used it on just about all my cloths khakis polos button-down shirts and it does a reasonably good job if i have one complaint about it it is that the cord is too short and with the steamer on the floor it will barely reach the top of an item hung using the over-the-door hook i also wish it had a way to fill the reservoir which is only oz with out removing the hose overall i think for the price that i paid i got my moneys worth after all it s just a tea kettle with a hose label steamer to spurter worked well for first couple of months but then just spews out spurts of water with a little steam label not very impressed after reading the reviews below i was looking forward to having an effective cheap steamer on hand however this conair doesn t do the job it starts emitting steam quickly but the steam had little impact on the condition of my dress shirts and suits to get even modest results i had to tug on the fabric to pull the wrinkles out given the time and effort it takes i d rather just iron label worth the price it is not bad if you just need a steamer for your dresses and it s perfect for temporary use like me but if you want to keep a long lasting one at home you d better spend more money and choose a better one this is not that good when using but i should say what do you expect from a steamer it s farely good especially for the price label steamer i bought this because i thought ironing was too much of a chore this thing is too much of a hassle for the results it works better on thinner fabrics and it s good to have around for delicate pieces though label not international usage it stopped working after minutes i think it burend i asume now it was not design for internation use because i used it on voltage label works for us it does its job just remember to always throw out the unused water from the tank to prevent mold label not worth it i got this product thinking that it would replace my iron and ironing board i was wrong it is not strong enough to take the wrinkles out of khaki pants or oxford shirts that are a cotton polyester blend the clothes do not hold their shape either it took me longer to steam a pair of pants than it would have for me to just iron them because of how you have to tough at the pants to make the fabric straight for the steamer i guess i was looking for an easy way out of ironing and this product was definitely not it label don t waste your time conair steamer does not work very well i think i can get a better steam in the shower you might be able to do a shirt in half an hour if you re lucky trust me don t waste your time with this item label not so good i read the same complaints and thought the same thing duh read instructions but the first three x it seemed ok now it is spitting and very awkward and takes a long time to get steam going i am looking for a new one label not impressed it does not put out enough steam and it does not have a steam switch button to release the steam or not release stem instead it is continual steam but it s paltry i returned itit did not do a better job than the pressure water spray bottle i have been using to finely mist my clothes which works great label not good this game has confusing graphics the play-control is horrible and the game is too repetitive label eh this bra is disappointing i was so excited to get it after all of the great reviews i think that it would be a great bra for smaller chested women i have always been a d and now after my first pregnancy-currently nursing a month old i m a dd e this bra is just a thin piece of material in front which is hard to tell from just online pictures i have wanted to return mine but am not sure if it s too late or not i just hate spending so much money on a bra that i m so unhappy with i did also purchase the bella materna padded nursing bra and it is fabulous i wear it all the time practically everyday and it is so comfortable and has held up incredibly well so i hate to be a debbie downer but the maternelle is just not the best for larger chested women label this really works another successful potty story medication and side effects of an illness left me highly irregular research brought me to magnesium citrate i trust solgar and buy it when possible for other vitamins three months later two pills and i can attest to being a x better what a relief label excellent resource i found this atlas to be an excellent resource for my college world civilization class i would recommend it for anyone who has an interest in or is a history student label very poor product this is by far the worst dual cassette deck that i have ever purchased the play back and record have very poor sound quality the tapes regardless of what kind do not play at the right speed in other words they play slower then other tape decks very unhappy label good product this is an excellent cassette deck it works as it should i e it plays and records music very well label disappointing well i never knew what a shooter on rails was until i got this game its not as much fun to play as the previous one because you only aim and shoot you don t control where your character goes it gets old quick too i m not sure i would recommend it even for a rental and the graphics are not too impressive but its a wii game so that goes without saying label big dissapointment after waiting for the game for some time i am very dissapointed with what i have seen the arcade style where you don t have much control over you re character is very annoying compared to re4 this is a very bad game the only thing that would make me play it is that i love resident evil unless you are a big fan of resident evil or enjoy playing arcade games don t consider this game label complete deparature from everything good in resident evil series we were so excited to buy this game we bought it the day it came out without reading any reviews big mistake we had loved all the other resident evil games so much that we had faith this one would also be great you cannot even control the characters in the game and it s basically just target practice for you and your wii controller none of the story line is new it s all scenes from previous games our favorite aspect of previous resident evil games is the puzzle-like quality where you need to collect things and figure out how to use them later on in the game this game required no thinking whatsoever very disappointing down the drain for minutes of disappointment label resident evil the umbrella chronicles this one is like resident evil the darkside chronicles you need to be young to play it and keep up not free form like resident evil which is way way better label zombie-killing fun this game is really fun i m a big fan of the resident evil movie series but this is the first re game i ve purchased it s a fun on-rails shooter game that is sufficiently challenging without being too frustrating plus it has jill valentine who is just the coolest character ever label fun my son really enjoyed this game came as described would buy from this seller again thank you label an interesting experience a very challenging game wich requires a lot of reflexes and a good aiming arm label great story and so different i really loved this story as it was so different it led me to looking for more information about the knights templar read a virginia henley book also desired that told more about them like others i would love to read a sequel about kadar and selene please label drab and boring this is really one of the worst games yet for the playstation there are obnoxious clipping and camera-angle problems which make fighting and exploring a chore and the graphics are drab and boring not what one would expect for a playstation game do yourself a favor and give this one a miss label pretentious dreck when will composers learn that the string quartet is not an effective medium for heroic themes these composers have far to go label yet another unnecessary sequel while the story is entertaining and readable the use of p p characters is quite unnecessary and somewhat distracting the development of characters reads more like the inspiration came from the bbc mini series than from the novel furthermore the sound of the dialogue is more often than not strictly modern who coiuld ever believe the darcy s would get caught up in something like this label plot was lame started ok but no other redeeming features as other reviewers describe the language is not period or british and the plot is horrid anachronisms all over the place especially in the newly introduced characters the american characters and the black magic themes do not work at all i agree with the reviewers who found the beginning of the book mildly intriguing with a nice relationship between darcy and elizabeth the book goes downhill from the point when the darcys discover the newly married caroline bingley walking in the gutter in the middle of the night the characterizations of the original p p characters are good the settings and wit are mostly acceptable but none are excellent or inspiring enough to even begin to overcome the plot deficiencies this one a loser i edited my review and gave pride and prescience a second star after reading an even worse p p sequal desire and duty at least pride and prescience had a mildly interesting beginning label interesting but full of errors this is a great book if you want a very brief history of fire engine manufacturers from around the world however it is riddled with errors regarding u s manufacturers for instance it shows a photo of a mount horeb wisconsin fire truck and claims it s in canada the authors do not seem to know that crown firecoach went out of business in the s and pirsch did so in the s the coverage of pierce is pathetically short given its prominence in the u s market if i can find these errors about u s companies in just five minutes one can only wonder how many more there for manufacturers from other countries that i have much less knowledge of overall a disappointing book since mine was defective cut off corner i will be returning it and will not order a replacement label special edition special edition has some cool but useless things but the game is the same old stuff you ve experienced in its prequels label horrible this game was not only horrible but it was too easy i beat the game in less than two hours and never played it again i do not intend on buying any other army men games anytime soon it was a complete waste of money and i hope i can stop you from buying it label appealing second book i love huskey s sense of humor and tragic life like stories once i read the first book i couldn t wait to read this one i love her style of writing label good wetsuit this wetsuit worked great and was easy to get on our month old but slippery when wet however it did provide a better grip than without it on overall i would recommend label don t buy this book if you bought the first edition i bought the first edition and was happy thinking i could update my skill i bought the second edition but was disappointed because there was virtually nothing new the second edition has an additional author but looks like that is the only addition to the second edition disappointed label acoustic japanese folk compilation of traditional folk dance music selections with vocals from various parts of japan some of these tracks are on other cds in the music of japanese people series these are more source type recordings although not field recordings but if one wants to get to the roots of the type of music which people like shoukichi kina nenes etc have electrified and modernized this is good stuff label same writer same voice i am a long time ccr fogerty fan have all the ccr studio cds numerous fogerty cds this is a good collection of john s ccr solo works i can understand the live recordings of almost saturday night rockin all over the world from premonition but the other live cuts should have been the studio versions also versions of fortunate son is a waste a few songs missing i enjoy change in the weather from eye of the zombie walking in a hurricaine from blue moon swamp all in all a good cd label go on and cry bloodstones from my hometown of kansas city missouri there the last of the great r b harmony groups and they are one of the best we go a long way back is a pure hennesy drinkin dim lights classic the true treasure on this cd is the song go on and cry here s a great line from that classic i had to go to the best friend i had-and that was my mother a must have cd for the serious r b group harmony collector of groups from the s and s label murder she wrote and wrote and wrote and wrote reruns of murder she wrote on cable tv were good for one thing power naps after work the episodes put me to sleep every time i have yet to master the art of falling asleep while reading the book is dull routine and dumb just like the tv show but not without that addictive pulp fiction downgraded iq quality that keeps the pages turning the resolution is a major let down like a cold burnt match concluding the final chapter when my elderly grandmother died i inherited took her boxes of paperback mysteries which certainly would have been tossed away by less inclined members of my family mostly classics of the genre and the oddball title like this based on the popular tv show assuming she had read this well-thumbed copy i m hoping gramma wasn t bored to ahem tears label good for stay at home phones me and my mp3 player are everywhere around town so i am constantly looking for good headphones i have had pair scince i got the mp3 player pair combined with the old cd player when i got these i thought they were awsome at first true they sound great true they are comfortable but they are by now means durable i droped them once in a bathroom and the fall to the floor cracked the inside plastic facing the ear on the headband so i took it home fixed it and then they got droped again the c claw that pivots the headphone broke each time i tried to fix it it was to no avail the one other thing i will give to it s credit it that it does fold up if you like headphones that you can really shut out the rest of the world with and then when you need to do some talking and put your phones away these will fold up neatly into a jacket pocket if you buy them try not to love them too much cuz they won t love you back label this is only the english paperback of ch be wary of this listing it is not the hardcover of the original volume instead it is a paperback albeit in good condition of the english translation of boldt s chapter this should have been a classic of german dressage but instead is an expensive drop in the bucket the paperback listing only comes up after you navigate to several layers of this site buyers beware label dire picture quality even for the die-hard collector of ballet films anna karenina is a dubious investment as other reviewers have said the picture quality of this vai release is terrible dark grainy and full of filmic flickers and sparkles recommended for fans of maya plisetskaya only for other fans of ballet save your money on this one label study guide for the therapeutic recreation specialist examination this product was very unhelpful because all of the answers were written next to each question in order to take the practice exams i had to white-out every answer on every page and it was a pain label excellent reference this book contains good descriptions and excellent photographs which makes it an outstanding reference for identification label a big slice of cheese these speakers are cheesy i had some other speakers made by the same company and they lasted for about years travel can be rough but they hung in there with me they were great slim had a nice case so i went with the same company mistake not as good as my first if you are just looking for something to sit close they do their job keeping in mind these are for travel so expect sound limitation i got the adapter unless you want speakers right next to you not a good option cord needs to be longer or go blue tooth hint hint label great buy great price for a great product arrived in timely fashion and worked exactly as promised absolutely no problems label worth it i had the philips sbc-hp140 for roughly years great set of phones i bought the hp170 to replace them at home and they ve been great the past months i now need phones for my lab and i have no hesitation in plumping for these again they re a worthy successor to my excellent s highly recommend i d give em stars label terrible i bought these headphones because i was impressed with the specs for the cheap price i later realized that these headphones have a cheap price for a reason they are not durable they do not cancel any sound and they just all around suck dont not buy these headphones for any reason whatsoever i recommend the senneheiser pro model headphones for a much better quality and sound label sonic impact the product was faulty one of the springs in the battery compartment was broken off so it will not hold the batteries properly label waste of time i bought this mini amp to power my watts speakers and it never worked don t waste your monies as its nothing more then a toy label a sociological masterpiece-or a disaster i ran into this book in when i transferred from a small college to a major university-not because i wanted to be preppy but because how it had absolutely consumed the majority of the student body to be as prep as possible-and it couldn t be avoided no matter how hard one tried to ignore it while the book was meant to be somewhat satirical the impact it had was huge at that time increasing and encouraging an already present us vs them mindset that i think persists to this day it s a good book nonetheless and i m surprised that a updated revised version hasn t come out by now but i shudder at the possible impact that would have label where is the market maker seeing the book title i had hoped to read about trading from the view of a market maker to my disappointment this book could have been written by anyone it s just like many other books on trading nothing in the book is a special contribution from a market maker this is of course understandable why would a market maker reveal his secret of how to make money and beat the traders and the public with his profession but then don t make a misleading title since you are writing the book just as any other author on trading label it wasn t about the alamo very disappointing we bought this video for my son prior to making a trip to the alamo after previewing it we didn t even bother to show it to him that said if you want to learn about the native tejanos or mexicans that lived in texas than this might be what you are looking for but otherwise the movie really didn t talk about the history of the alamo if you want to learn about the alamo look elsewhere we were very disappointed with this dvd label bad customer service i ordered this book and realized the day after i placed the order that my boyfriend had bought it for himself when i emailed the seller to see if it was too late to cancel my order and the reason i got no response i sent another email days later and i still never received a response i then got the book which i m stuck with and not even in good condition bad experience label it s a downgrade vista is a great example of bloatware my laptop came with vista and it was really slow for a ghz cpu with gb of ram the interface reduced my productivity i got really annoyed when it kept asking me to enter the admin password for anything i wanted to do the battery was supposed to last hour but lasted less than that i tried making a copy of a dvd and it wouldnt let me some software of the software i use was not compatible with it it totaly sucks i had to upgrade back to windows xp with a dual boot to ubuntu which has nicer desktop graphics than vista label too many drivers missing i like microsoft but vista makes the use of my computer so limited i use computers one with xp and one with vista i try to put everything on the vista computer but now have programs that won t work on vista and therefore i need computers on my desk i would immediately go back to xp on this computer but right now i don t have the time until drivers are updated on more programs i recommend using xp label the worst i have ever seen seriously microsoft should be ashamed if any other company had produced something like vista they would now be bankrupt purchased a laptop that had vista installed on it had troubles from day one absolutely could not set up my network i previously had two computers that ran on xp they were doing fine on the network no peripherals work for the average user the problems greatly outweigh any benefits vista has over xp label vista an xp pro service pack as far as i m concerned microsoft could have made a service pack or for windows xp pro then you could apply the patches needed to run the upgrade as far as i m concerned microsoft is out just to make money thats all they care about windows xp pro will be my last windows os i myself will be changing over to lenix os i can t belive that microsoft went to all this trouble to make vista with all the different versions to boot people if you want to upgrade to vista be my guest microsoft can have and keep their vista os i am removing mine and reinstalling xp pro until i do my change over to lenix os i will never purchase a new computer with vista on it label horrible do not get vista absolutely the worst operating system ever created do not get vista for anything it is full of glitches do not listen to the microsoft ads your computer will freeze it will crash and be times slower vista also leaves your computer completely open to viruses and spyware the windows was a better operating system vista convinced me to finally get a mac which was by far the best computer buying decision i have ever made the mac operating system is completely user friendly fast no crashes and no viruses it s just so better organized and with no glitches to report yet plus it s ready to use right out of the box do not get vista get a mac label nothing but problems purchased this up-grade and had so many problems i have removed it from my computer caused problems with my hp scanner printer with i-tunes and my i-pod to name a some of the trouble don t buy unless u have many hours to waste on attempted fixes and back door action to do any work label wait if you can if you will be purchasing a computer in the next year i would recommend that you wait to buy vista purchase your next pc with it installed and you may save yourself a lot of aggrevation and head aches my installation was horrific and made my other pc unusable for many hours and many hours of my time to get working label let off some steam bennett working at a bookstore one gets to see all the really nifty right-wing books that come in books from the insatiable ann coulter to the rotund william bennett of course these books are prominently displayed as the right-wing will go into hysterics if they were not and cry liberal cabal the gambler bennett well he s broke even with his new manual on how to convince the world on the need to end moral decline once and for all in the united states especially after the wretched events of and of course the gambler has all the answers to our problems but as spencer tracy says to fredric march in the classic film inherit the wind it s a shame we don t all possess your positive knowledge of what is right and what is wrong mr brady label elites never sacrifice in this book mr bennett says many of us have forgotten what we once knew about our freedoms and our decencies and we have forgotten why time and time again we have had to rally ourselves to the point of ultimate sacrifice to defend them mr bennett never describes what these decencies are for example gambling is legal but many find this distasteful so is gambling not a decent thing to do t but the big fault i have with this book is that mr bennett tells us that we must sacrifice but mr bennett has not sacrificed by serving in the military which for me makes him appear to be an elitist label very safe i have put fuel into these cans and cannot return them so am stuck with them i purchased several metal fuel cans in assorted sizes for both gas and diesel what these pictures do not show is it is virtually impossible to put your chosen fuel into these cans you need at least four hands and maybe more for the larger size cans after my first time of trying to fill my mower from the one gallon can i realized the assorted safety virtues are there for those people who have no clue kind of like the ones who designed the can i suppose unless the whole idea is if you can t get fuel into the can you are safe people whose hands are small have a hard time with these cans people with large hands may have it easier i spilled nearly the entire gallon when filling my mower back to plastic i think if i ever find an older metal can at a yard sale i will be much happier label performance now i was not happy with this software because i couldn t even load it i got an error everytime i loaded it and i had tried to load on another computer as well and got the same result i had to return the product for a return i was not satisfified with my purchase at all label does not work with nb-lh canon rebel xt battery i m not sure if i m a special case or not but my battery fits into the charger and it plugs in and the lights flash and everything however when i pop the battery back into the camera after a long charge nothing to make sure that the problem was the charger not the battery i tried charging the battery with a friends charger who has the same camera voila no problem again i m not sure if i have a defective model and i appreciate the company offering an affordable model however this turned out not to be a viable option for me label less than thrilled my product got lost in the mail which come to find out is not that uncommon with eastbay when i called to report what had happened i found out that they were out of my husband s size needless to say i had to get him the next size up and it was way too big in their defense they did mail me the replacement free of charge through rush shipping label good intense yoga workout i have a number of yoga videos but this is the one i use to work out mark has a wonderful intensity and enthusiasm and the workout is at a high level not really for beginners but very good for anyone who wants to extend their yoga experience very nice label tuna flavored laxatone remedy for hairballs i know a lot of people use petrolatum for hairballs but my cat prefers the tuna flavored laxatone she is of course a cat and a very finicky one at that the tuna flavor makes it more a treat for her which makes it easy for me to administer it label wonderful book i love all of the cape light books i hope there will be more than they are so relaxing to read and they make you feel like you really know all the people they bring in the christian parts of the book and make you feel so much closer to god i love the books so much label too much repetition seems like the authors wrote this book without communication amongst each other there is a lot of repetition this book is over pages and could be summarized in pages in each chapter you re-read over and over again the stuff you ve just read it is also quite elementary the quizz at the end of each chapter are really basic and nothing like the mcq you get in a college class the good point is that there are a lot of examples label aaa seller superfast delivery product was in condition as promised covers and pagers were completely in tact and undamaged this particular book had an excessive amount of distracting highlighting marks in it but i m sure this was a rare exception i would definitely do business with this seller again label mrs parks does it again electa rome parks delivers another page turner in almost doesn t count this book is a great read with unexpexted plot twists that you won t believe label caution sinnerman runs mins power etc liked the movie so i wanted to get the soundtrack but it doesn t play well for me as a regular listenable cd relatively short min cd and sinnerman is the whole song you ll hear power more than you wish for i dare you to count the snippets in the movie are easier to take conti s instrumentals are lumped at the end and run short and repetitive can t say i listen to this much but have been thinking of just taping the parts i like label ticked about the lack of stuff here the whole problem with the soundtrack is that the nice stuff the stuff that made the movie feel ritzy and glamourous the jazz and the piano the sting soundtrack and the rest of the stuff is here but the music that rounded out the whole movie itself such as the song from the lovemaking scene between russo and brosnson is not here the music from the original heist is not here hell half the music from the whole thing isn t here which makes this while a nice cd to listen to not what i d even want to buy i listened to it i returned it to the rack and i walked out i wouldn t buy it and mgm better start figuring out the amount of space that a cd actually has and what is decent music to listen to and what is not welcome to the digital world riaa label thomas crown affair soundtract the cd was brand new and i love the songs it came in the mail extremley fast even though it was a week before christmas label worked great for a while i have had mine for a few years and it worked great now the female end is leaking like crazy and of course there is no way to repair this i contacted melnor their name was on this and they gave me a bum rush regarding this and disavowed any responsibility sort of odd since their brand name is on it so i guess this goes to the dump don t waste your money if you are expecting this to work long term label the best book in it s field this is a book that all students of intrnational politics and international relations should have on their shelves professors smith and baylis have managed to create the finest textbook ever written on the subject it is put together in such a way that it is both easy to use and full of relavant in-depth information very highly recommended label does not work i bought one and it never worked right bought it at office depot they would not replce after days so i shipped to brother and they sent me another it didn t work right either my guess is the networking setup just doesn t work can t scan or print labels or envelopes called brother back and they wouldn t do anything more so i just had to replace at my own cost label ink consumption is the only drawback here the people who rave on this item do so because they have not replaced ink yet or got it for around i paid a little more than a and let me tell you that i am disappointed in the fact that i had to buy a complete ink set about six months ago and have had maybe black and white faxes faxed to me i was expecting an important fax today and suprise i cant recieve it because cyan is out these cartridges cost an arm and a leg too almost sixty bucks full set i am going to break my own creed and now go to cartridge world if i refill with brother ink one more time full set it will be more than i paid for the machine the machine is sturdy and works great just a money pit when it comes to ink damn glad i don t have to use color label waste of money i started reading this book a few days ago because i wanted to learn more about the life of mata hari but the author talks about other topics instead of the main subject i don t really recommend this book unless you wanna know more about other topics that are not related to mata hari label absolutely useless this atlas was absolutely useless during our trip to ireland it did not provide detailed maps of the cities and the layout and organization was horrible the free map we got from the rental car agency was of more use than this atlas do not buy this product label great music comp i followed the story on tv and wanted to buy the music ever since glad i found it i would recommend it to anyone label it was butchered cliff is turning over in his grave i liked mash-up but i love metallica the first seconds i thought i was going to sick sick i hated it you can t mess with perfection period i wouldn t even give this album a single star all the songs were butchered man cliff must be turning over in his grave label gardener tool not powerful enough for most shrubs or bushes in my garden charge doesnot last long either label american gardener this is the second shear i have purchased the old one was good except the battery didnt hold a good charge after about years hope this ones better label disappointing there is nothing new in this book its like a collection of bits from all the other books i ve read it seems to tread carefully around the important issues in adoption i am very disappointed with it label do not waste your time i have read many of amis s books and have enjoyed most of them immensely this is one that up until now i have missed and i wish i had kept it that way a feeble attempt at an american style mystery novel with a weak plot line no beleivable character development and a ending which is effectively non existent this is a book that is amis going through the motions to pick up his pay check do not buy this even if you are a fan of his work label moves along well but to where nicely written mystery police procedural variety but without any real knowledge of police work unfortunately for me when i finished it i read the last chapter twice i couldn t figure out the answer if anyone can help please let me knowdid she or didn t she and if she didn t who did label not the greatest thing well when i got this book i thought that there was going to be more action in it but it is just a story about a girl who did suicide i am not done with it yet this book also has to many swears in it no one talks like that only teens do that are immature i can t wait to be done with this book label english rose was a compelling follow up in north america to their excellent debut english rose finds fleetwood mac adding danny kirwan a third guitarist to the line-up horns also appear for the first time other than that this lp is a natural follow up to the band s excellent chicago blues debut standouts are kirwan s something inside of me and without you and of course the three peter green classics love that burns albatross and black magic woman as one listens to green wail on magic it becomes crystal clear why both bb and eric consider him to be one of the great guitarists had fleetwood mac not morphed into a mega pop band in they would still have occupied a significant position in the history of english blues this version of the band was a supremely talented and confident gathering of musicians and as much as i enjoyed fleetwood mac when it became the biggest band in the world i have more affection for the various versions label top westerns ever written i have read this book times for the last years each time is fresh and new historically accurate and a darn good yarn deserves to be kept on the shelf with the daybreakers by louis l mour and the bubbling spring by ross santee label jesus was born at the end of the year bc all old church fathers except one report that jesus was born at the end of the year b c and the catholic council of vatican i in said when there is a problem in the church on which the church never gave a decision then you have to look what the old church fathers say to it that opinion or the majority of it has to be accepted as the proper answer second there is the problem with the wrongly dated death of herod he died in bc and not in bc furthermore there is the quirinius-problem as jack finegan in his handbook of biblical chronology princeton wrote sulpicius quirinius was ruling in and bc this would fit with the church fathers the astronomical question much closer conjunctions we had in august bc in june bc and in august bc and on december bc jupiter stood without a move in the middle of virgin therefore this book missed to give a true answer on the problem label promises a lot and delivers very little this book has been hyped up as being the definitive text for microsoft crm in reality it delivers very little while offering more than the dummies guide to crm any user can gain more insight into the application using the docs supplied with crm such as the implementation guide and also just by using the applicationstill waiting for an intermediate to advanced text on microsoft crm label this book s sell-by date has long since passed i don t think anybody is still using microsoft crm version so be sure the title you choose covers the version of crm you need which is probably version or at this date label tom s cruz a cuban legend vol starts assuming that you have never played the congas or have had any previous knowledge of how to play i found this book and dvd very helpful even though much of it is basic i discovered that i had learned certain movements incorrectly and was able to correct myself by viewing the dvd you will also learn basic exercises and rudiments that are very helpful in improving your speed however remember that this is a volume series and book number and are crucial to further your learning process it is my opinion that if you want to learn to play a cuban instrument you should learn from a cuban not a person who just studied in cuba a few times tomas is educated and born in havana i highly recommend this book you can not imagine how much i have learned from it as i play people can tell how much better i sound after using this method label beautiful hirts garden must have packed little elves along with my lava plant to protect it i thought i made a mistake and ordered a fake plant that s how wonderful it is i have my eye on more from hirts garden thank you label words words words this book isn t about one man s love of the open road it s a paean to his love for his own voice as we are interminably subjected to his rambling circular paisley stylings somewhere near the beginning of the book he mentioned that we unlike his family had the advantage of being able to put the book aside as a break which not only made me put the book down many many times but made me want to stage an intervention for his obviously long-suffering family label ugh this book was painful to finish i kept hoping that it would get better it didn t as others have mentioned there were too many storylines that were completely undeveloped apparently in a deliberate attempt to get you to read prequels and sequels however the worst part of the book for me was the character of bayleigh stewart a k a shadow her character was completely annoying as she seemed to behave completely inconsistently and irrationally for example when a misunderstanding arises between bayleigh and the hero long quiet rather than explain her situation and clear up all the problems bayleigh keeps forgetting to talk to him or missing her opportunity very clumsily handled overall none of the characters are believable in their motivations or behaviors also no author should use the word manroot in what is intended to be a serious love scene i actually laughed out loud label nothing outstanding frankly for a book on how to buy rv s i was disappointed in one of his chapters on what to advoid don launches into a multipaged bashing of two ethnic clans that hustle unsuspecting people with sales of poorly constructed rv that are made in in this was not advice it was pure racism label not as advertised this is advertised as linda eder and barbara streisand s cd it is only the music and not these two wonderful artists singing label impulse buy i quickly ordered of these as gifts without realizing that they were only instrumental karaoke type cds thank goodness that i was able to retrieve out of the before they were opened i had to return them but did keep one that was opened disappointment label is this serious i will be the first to say that girl talk s night ripper is simply incredible and it never seizes to amaze me everytime i listen to it which is approaching the thousands this obsession led to a understandable girl talk high prompting me to order this album to be honest i spent the first hour of owning it testing the cd in every disc playing device i owned making sure that my ears weren t deceiving me i was convinced the disc was severely scratched or damaged however i was completely wrong the tracks are supposed to be like that one of the most annoying things i can think of is a cd skipping killing a mood this entire album is intentionally like that and it s repulsing purchase night ripper which is nearly perfect but under no circumstances purchase this album label girl talk secret diary secret diary is girl talk in embryonic form the mash-ups here are more akin to kid606 than the smooth segues that girl talk would be known for so things sound a little rough unlimited s get ready for this crashes into on let s start this party right while i want you back seems to be a grab bag of chopped vocals without much direction at least until the mj appears the album is unabashedly glitchy and washes out some samples in layers of noise such that there s barely anything recognizable on ffun have to or time to get glamourous he does show his sense of humor in juxtaposition on what if however smooshing joan osborne with some ghetto rap it s more sacrilegious the new kids on the block get similar treatment on the right stuff elsewhere the price is right theme gets mangled on unicorn vs gravity and destiny s child is whupped on jumpin g you can see the seeds here but they ve not yet sprouted label not the girl talk you re used to in fact this is pretty much like others have said unlistenable a bunch of almost random noises and samples pasted together in mish-mash fasion with little thought i could author a better album by taking digital video of my cat using the litter box and converting the video signals to digital sound samples in fact i may just go do that right now it would be a better use of my time than listening to this cat crap label think twice first price was steep for one piece second a lil false advertising they show you a multi-piece set and only ship you one so please think first before you buy label great basic gps if you want a gps that will tell you where to turn left to get on the turnpike this isn t it but if you want to know exactly where you are on the planet the magellan and do an excellent job of it with full channel satellite tracking the highest available the nobs are complicated at first but most guys like learning that sort of thing this is basically the perfect gift for geeky dads or hikers btw the screen on the and as well as the features are superior to the etrex basic model although that model is far more ergonomic label not getting lost in my backyard or on the back roads just using the electronic moving compass feature helped plot out the boundaries of my lot of land when i found all the corners the lat long feature let me place marker post for a fence it would be good better if the altitude feature was more accurate i could use it to make a topographical map of my land too the reading i do get are just estimates ft while on trips out of town or out of state having been to my destination at least once in the past w my i can use the eta feature estimate time of arrival for getting there or coming back home the landmarks storage memory is well enough for my use i have added several burger and pizza places to the list for fun label a very good watch i had this watch for years until the strap broke so i bought it again it has three alarms which is very useful if you have multiple engagements in a day that you don t want to miss the timer and the stopwatch are also really useful label exciting plot with unexpected twists as a mother of boys i am always looking for books to engage them the wreckers takes an exciting topic and adds unexpected twists to the storyline creating a good deal of reader curiosity i found it difficult to resist reading just one more chapter the adventures that entertwine the two main characters make for a very enjoyable read as for the unfamiliar shipping terminology the th grade teacher reviewer found cumbersome i thought it added authenticity to the story this book can be a fairly quick read and has all the elements of a suspenseful read-aloud i have purchased a copy for my th grader s teacher and have recommended it to several others i am looking forward to the sequel label a good strong cordless vacuum this is second eureka b i have purchased other than the vendor true value shipping a purple color when the photo and prior one was black it is an excellent cordless vacuum lots of power and easy to use also does not scratch wood floors label beware of hair i bought this product years ago and it is overall good at picking up all dust and crumbs especially on carpets however as it picks up any hair they immediately get rolled up in the roller there is no easy way to get tangled hair off of the roller i have to sit there and cut and pull off the dirty hair in order to keep the vacuum working well and the roller not full of hair for people with short hair i see how this wouldn t be a problem but any woman knows that when you brush your hair you lose strands and they get caught in corners label great quick vaccum for hard surfaces we use this on our vinyl flooring and a short pile rug picks up a lot of dirt and dust does well with pet and people hair and today it picked up a chilli powder mess quickly not very loud either only problem i have is reinserting the filter after emptying because it s a little tricky to get it in just right without the rubber outer edge sticking out too much actually fun to use label it didn t impress me i was disappointed wit this vac not as much suction as i would have like and you have to hang the thing up to recharge it the extra battery was a nice touch for the money it might not be bad but i wish i had spent a little more for a better vac label good for quick pick-ups i have been very pleased with this little vac i run it through the kitchen and bathrooms almost daily for hair pick-up and it works great on the hard surface floors and small throw rugs i only gave this stars due to two small design flaws perhaps they are user issues the first being the button that clicks the base back into the stick it is a little small and it doesn t feel like it really locks the unit in for some reason i also have a tough time fitting the filter back into the unit properly after emptying it but neither of those issues are a big deal to me it is a good product for the price and it arrived in one business day label i could not be more pleased i live in a new york city studio and this product could not be any better for me it is compact and easy to store out of view it has very good suction both on carpet and wood floor areas and it is not too noisy i love it label handy and quick i was looking for an easy-to-use vac mostly for quick pet hair pick up this one fills the bill just fine and it s lightweight my only complaint would be cleaning the filter and brushes after each use but you can t beat it for the price label the eureka quick-up is very time work saving this one i bought for my daughter as i have one myself and like it very much she got two different vacuums for christmas so i don t know which one she ll keep the disadvantage of the eureka is that you have to clean the filter often i dump out the crumbs etc but the cat hair i have to use a tooth brush to clean the filter i d prefer not to have to touch the dust etc otherwise it s a great little vacuum i use it often on the kitchen floor and small areas on the carpeting when necessary label eureka b a good buy i am overrall pleased with the purchase the unit is not too noisy the suction is good and i like the rotary brush that can be activated for carpeting after each vacuuming i m surprised at how much it picks up we have cats my only suggestion for new buyers is for them to purchase a second battery the original one lasts about minutes or so and i don t charge it until it s fully drained due to the memory retention effect of nickel cadmium batteries label buy this if you want to poison your dog this book stinks i bought it a few months ago and immediately returned it amazon is awesome this is just random recipes with no dog nutrition in mind i bought it thinking it would show me creative and fun ways to safely make my dogs something they would really enjoy instead i got a book filled with random recipes of common household foods with no nutritional value for a dog in mind some of the recipes even included raisins there were other things in the book that you should not feed your dog but i don t recall what those were anymore i just remember being highly upset that this book was actually being sold don t buy this label mf horn series this album was my introduction to maynard as a high school trumpet player this lp simply blew my mind i have given up trumpet playing but not my love for maynard and his music his albums dominate my record collection bravo to wounded bird for putting this on cd i am waiting for rest of the mf horn series to come out on cd this album rocks as does the whole mf series if you like screaming trumpet this album is the one label m f horn vol big band jazz terrific big band jazz mf is a master of the horns band is great and enthusiastic classic sounds and songs an outstanding five star jazz collectible label major r k cross brought the book to life i hope you all enjoyed major r k cross he is my english professor mr howard bahr is a very commendable man he also has a very nice laid-back-on-the river-in-the-summer-sipping jack-daniels-and-lemonade drawl he is quite inspiring label excellent historical fiction this is one of the few books which i have felt compelled to read more than once the story is entertaining from front to back cover with mr bahr managing to pull the reader along with a writing style that is unique and engaging i found the characters believable and the action intense mr bahr delivers a strong story without giving in to predictable sentimentalities that plague so many novels of this type i recommend this book to anyone interested in a good story not only those with an interest in american civil war history label don t buy it unless you like really loud rattling noises stay far away from this product the pump is very poorly isolated from the hood assembly if you don t get it seated just exactly right it vibrates like crazy causing a horrible noise very loud what s worse it seems that even if you do get it seated right over time it shifts causing the vibration noise again i am extremely unhappy with this sure it looks nice and is convenient but unless you have total hearing loss or live in an assembly plant the noise makes it a worthless purchase i d give it zero stars if i could label owners manual in large print the book is two books in one a rehash of the owners manual but with some errors like referring the reader to the non-existant metering mode button and a tutorial on basic photography if you already know what depth-of-field is and how to compose a shot and if you still have your owners manual from the d50 save your money and skip this book label ge although i haven t much experience with way radios i have found it to be a most satisfactory device it is very easy to use and has excellent range it is also very clear the only things which might be considered faults are that it is not entirely water-resistent and tends to act strangely in the cold weather i found the multitude of functions quite impressive such as the battery-level indicator and the temperature the pager is also very handy as is the ability to lock one s settings i would definitely recommend this product label great compilation from dino have no idea what the displayed album art shown above is but it s not this cd this cd contains songs from dino and each one s a gem a lot of his hits and some that should have been hits the collection includes that s amore once in a while when you re smiling innamorata true love non dimenticar volare you belong to me just say i love her dream a little dream of me just in time i ve grown accustomed to her face return to me someday come back to sorrento you re nobody til somebody loves you dream standing on the corner you re breaking my heart memories are made of this i don t know why i ll alway love you label a pure jewel truffaz pushes further the exploration of jazz with magrehbin sonorities and electronic influences it is a total success an audacious project that i class in the first rank of my montreal jazz festival discoveries label i like invader zim but the latest in a long line of attempts to cash in on the invader zim license it seem like these dvd sets omit many of the great special features included in the initial dvd s that garnered the fan base they have now invader zim is a quirky dark cartoon that never got a fair shake from nickelodeon because of shows like rugrats clogging up the airwaves anyone who s wandered into a hot topic in the past few years knows what a cash-cow viacom missed out on by cutting this series short that being said these dvd s don t do the show justice do yourself a favor and track down the initial three volume dvd release used to enjoy all the extras commentaries and animatics for episodes that were never completed label come on invader zim well the girls at my school like this show but i personally don t like it because they are starting to act like that gir character and i mean come on a dog that is a robot i would not recommend this to children label they are not serious this was the most demented and disturbing cartoon ever made since aaah real monsters i mean seeing a giant ailen zit pop what is that i have no idea why people even like this show label one word what kind of show is this this show is the stupidest thing ever nicktoons used to have good shows like hey arnold parents do not let your kids watch this show or they will think every thing is related to aliens and outer space label i love this album my initial thought was that a band with such long of a name couldn t be any good i was completely wrong i accidentally saw them live and bought the album the next day there are a few other reviewers here that do this album more justice than i can what i can say is that i love it interesting compositions fun lyrics realistic lyrics unique and extremely listenable i love this album label poor print quality don t buy this book i just received mine and the type print is terrible the book is a photocopy ofthe original and the print is very light illegible on some pages and generally hard to read find anedition from a different publisher label horrible this cd is horrible the cheap unbalanced music arrangement and the ear-scratching voices are just insane i realize this cd is for babies but man they have ears too why torture them label replacement filters have not been utilized as yet i purchased these replacement filters to help reduce the possibility of mineral white dust forming from our hard water since we just recently purchased the humidifier and it came equipped with an initial filter included we have not had to use this replacement set the recommendation is that these filters should be replaced every months label spt ion f replacement filter okay it s a replacement filter i guess it works just fine i will continue to purchase these because i will continue to have a need no negatives about the product to speak of label awesome superscope pac770 we own of these awesome units at locations and use them several hours each day by several different fitness instructors superscope has also provided us with excellent service on a couple units where staff abused the cd tray on one and buttons on another we are looking to buy more units each year for the next years as we plan to add more studios i hope the new units are in stock soon label nothing special if you want to see hudson leick topless something about sex has a better scene for that it s a decent overall movie though she only has a bit part in it she has a larger role in this movie but it still doesn t save the movie from mediocrity combined with elements of rape drug use i just found it hard to enjoy label grant seeking in an electronic age i recommend not purchasing this book the book purchased new for over then express shipped for a grant writing course in graduate school is literally falling apart the quality is poor the publishers should be ashamed i agree with another reviewer that the charts are poor i feel sorry for the authors that this book is of such poor quality from the publisher because i liked the smaller chapters which were written in a clear concise writing style however this book is not for an advanced researcher or writer more tailored to freshmen level label slow delivery restocking fee the ornament is cute looks just like the picture the description says ceramic pig ornament and shows ornaments in the picture but i only received one so i felt the item description was very misleading i placed the order weeks before a christmas gift exchange and did not receive the shipment in time for the exchange so i had to return it the company charges a restocking fee for returns from orders placed through amazon so you may want to consider this when ordering label not really worth it first off i am not a big pmm fan i heard their song on the end of days sound track and thought it was pretty good that song is on this cd but as a with shittier production this might be a cd a nin fan might like but i as a devout follower of godsmack and static-x thought it sucked label garbage can material you have to be in the tiny range of protestants and vatican ii catholics who love the present vatican movement to merge catholics and lutherans as one religion to buy any basic premise in this book it will not teach you one valid thing that you can use to christianize anyone and it can only serve as an emotional warm fuzzy if you fit the stated reader profile you will not come away with any useful argument but you could in a self delusion find yourself with your arguments pitted against others such as well educated fundamental christians and traditional catholics who have daggers five inches long buyer beware i threw my copy in the trash can label handbook of christian apologetics this book was very informative if you are looking for answers to defend your christian faith this is the book to have it is also a good study tool label don t expect too much if you are non-believer when i bought this book i was non-believer of christianity who expect dramatic break through about christianity from this book and i got badly disappointed while the author did great job on some field but overall the book contains fundamental problems of christian apologetics such as mentioning the bible to back up his logistics for non-believer it wouldn t work if you choose bible as primary reference for your explanation since non-believer do not believe the bible itself it is like explaining gravity to someone who doesn t understand the newton s law itself because newton says so wouldn t work to make it work the author should see things as non-believer but it is as much hard as the non-believer tries to understand the believer it is a good book but i have a doubt if it is useful book label merlin mustek bearpaw scanner i hate it i was ripped off when i bought this how could i know that i would never be able to ugrade it to a new operating system you could at least write new drivers for windows xp and windows i feel cheated rose mary hughes label not a classical music affecionato i m not a particular fan of classical music because it puts me to sleep however this selection which pulls out familiar parts is good listening and enjoyable because one can recognize the music from movies excerpts etc very enjoyable for someone who can t sit through a symphony label really how can anyone be expected to get into this book i ve heard how great it was from friends but its just so unbelieveable that its hard to get into the story i mean harry potter was more realistic and believable then this i hated harry potter shame people are in love with such poor fiction writing label truth i have never heard of this jesus person till just recently i could not believe no one told me about him before this book had so many great stories in it then i found out people actually thought they were true are ya brain dead label book of lies the problem with this book is not that its lame and boring which it is the problem is that people think its nonfiction label what king james is this of which king james one of england france scotland anyway this is a very nice little bible to have it is a beautiful and traditional bible with a leather cover and gold words which say holy bible on the front put god into your life peace label good but not quite great i feel that this book started out well but lacked something of an ending the writing styles change intermittedly and seem to lack something of a finesse blatantly stating things that cannot be taken literally or figuratively well enough to purvey a superior understanding of the text i found it about as entertaining as flipping through a t v guide but not owning a t v seeing all the shows that you could be watching explained in a summerized detail that never quite lets you know what it s really all about a true literary flop label stuffy and overrated put it right on the shelf with the rest of the fiction sex violence persecution discrimination racism incest murders aplenty this book has it all on top of that it s hard to read because of the archaic use of language written years after the alleged death of jesus translated by just about anyone who wanted to rewritten by every ruler who didn t like what the older version said why does the bible have more sex than a daytime soap because sex sells label meh starts off with a bang but kinda drags towards the middle the author needs to do some work on pacing and climactic elements could ve used a vampire too label perfect all purpose bible this is a great bible for someone looking to get a bible that isn t watered down through translation nice unassuming hard cover sharp printing contains more words that the niv has removed including words like mercyseat jehovah and godhead it contains meaningful well-known bible words like calvary lucifer new testament regeneration that the niv leaves out completely don t be deceived by all those here that don t want people to have a true copy of the bible there s a reason so many have gone out of their way to write a star review for this product label my most valued cd i bought the series of last good place on earth when i visited the united states in from the nature company i brought them back to malaysia and listen to them to remember the good places that i visited for years when my family moved to the united states in glacier bay bayou the caribbean and cloud forest are the very few precious cds that i have taken with me label beyblades this blade is the best but ifyouchange weight desks withany blade it will be unstoppible label best printer i ve ever owned i was at staples looking at the new canon printers to replace my old bjc when the m750 caught my eye i asked for a demo and bought the machine tried to set it up using usb connection no-go but the problem was in my hp8490 computer parallel setup was extremely easy i have had a couple of false error signals but nothing i can t live with fewer than with any of the canon or hp printers i ve had the bw print is crisp and clear was used to print registries for a worldwide military association in fact my boss and i were so impressed with this printer that we purchased one to use to print invoices at our office the black and white quality of this printer is better than the hp1220 professional ink jet printer we own i haven t compared the color quality yet we are planning to purchase at least two more for the office i would recommend this to anyone or any business that prints pages per day label good impression after two weeks i have had this printer for about two weeks now and so far it is an excellent value out of the box it was easy to set up and the drivers were a snap one caution for w2k users though drivers for w2k need to be downloaded from the internet i am not sure why xerox does it that way but the drivers do install quite easily print quality is great and you have four levels of detail i print a monthly tenant newsletter and i use draft quality to save ink it printed out copies in about minutes in draft mode overall i am impressed with the quality i will complain that the receiver tray can pop off sometimes during printing a strange effect indeed with all the advantages though i run mine via usb and an awesome price i highly recommend this printer you will not be dissappointed label piece of crap i have wasted hours trying to get this printer to work properly even when it was brand new and sort of worked the print quality was terrible with fuzzy characters and colors that were way off and yes i was using the right kind of paper i have gotten about thirty barely usable pages out of this printer after that it began to malfunction xerox did its customers and itself a big disservice by ever selling this piece of junk label good quality for price i was so impressed by the low price and comparable print quality of the m750 that i decided to try it instead to date i haven t had any problems with the machine and am quite pleased with its performance it is a great piece of equipment for a home-based business or family-owned pc label incorrect samples incorrect album can t believe after all this time since amazon were first alerted that the samples are still playing the wrong album is the download the correct album does anyone know label no fun i really can t say anything good about this game the controls are way too slow and the models are painfully simple i only got through levels before deciding that this game was not worth my time label book my husband really enjoyed reading this biography he could hardly put the book down well written and very interesting label complex individual chernow is one of the few biographers who can take an enormous amount of information on a subject and create a book that is even-handed and interesting since this is a figure that is both reviled and lionized i think the author s purpose was to present all sides to this complex person and let the reader come to his own conclusions chernow s research of rockefeller s childhood reveals a lot about the way he turned out as an adult and the author s writing style points out both his strengths and shortcomings as well as showing how standard oil s rise to the top came about and the ruthless actions rockefeller took to get it there in the latter part of the book as rockefeller retires and ages the book concentrates mostly on john jr as well as his daughters and heirs while this was necessary for a complete story i felt some of this could have been edited better this is still a first-rate detailed biography label titan by ron chernow simply put this book is a sheer masterpiece it is well researched and is absolutely brilliantly written after reading it i started reading it all over again i am an avid reader of non-fiction and this is one the best i have read encore label a for titan this is an excellent biography it is the only one that i have read on rockefeller if anyone is interested in him and or standard oil read this book first it is extremely well written and chernow did a great job in holding my attention this book it times better than the late joseph wall s biography of andrew carnegie titan is not slanted or biased either way regarding rockeffer don t be daunted by the book s size it is a great book label ejay is better this program is ok but it doesn t have enough samples as much as ejay i highly reccomend that you take one of the ejay cds techno rave dance hip-hop etc or take ejay se thanksdanny dyer label everything about it strokes the senses don t pick up this book unless you plan to stay up all night susan leslie liepitz draw you in deep with characters so real they might come knocking at your door captain blake masters is a true hero-very human in spite of being handsome compassionate yet practical and realistically frustrating at times ms liepitz chooses words exquisitely in her sensual prose the transitions in time are plausible and the author s take on how people perceive life after death touches the heart this is a mystical story woven well everything about it strokes the senses giving the imagination a curl-your-toes workout stars cyndie dennis-greer reviewing for romantic times label micro fiber panties not at all what i thought i was getting if i thought these were going to be thinner than a slip feels thinner than pantyhose and overall uncomfortable and see through i wouldn t have bought them in white pants you can t wear them they weren t comfortable for me maybe for others label ye olde programmed software crash i had long loved my ti but it finally met it s doom after going thru three highschool careers between me and the kids i bought the cas as a replacement and felt comfortable immediately with the calculator after a few months the software mysteriously erased itself no os installed so i worked on reinstalling the only issue is that you must purchase additional software from ti and they could not care less about your device that crashed and that you already paid for it it s sad a calculator company can t continue their use of stable software and after it fails won t back it up label disappointing compared to hall s other work this book gives us a brief picture of life in the south pacific during wwii but it s not so much about the war as it is about the inevitability of change the author tries to present the so-called tragedies of industrialization injected into an idyllic environment of stagnant though supposedly blissful island culture although i did enjoy this book especially the can-do attitude of the american army and navy engineers the obvious dichotomy between the american sense of life and the anti-technology philosophy that plagues the main character is disappointing label drigerf hey when i gotthis toy i swear i thoughtit was the worst blade everbut if you buy more beybladesand switch the blades weight destit will be strong label do not bother this blade is bad trust me if you want a powerful beyblade stick with drigger v believe me when i used it i broke two of my launchers i am the leader of my own blade sharks team and the bottom line do not get this blade i suggest drigger v label great this bey rocks although it doesnt have a good endurance its attack is awesome but i warn you this blade is not for ametuers you need to know jus how to spin it so itdoesnt go in a pocket im me at skaterman927 on aim let it rip label works with factory steering controls seamlessly i ordered this to work with my factory subaru steering wheel controls and pioneer avic-x910bt head unit and it works perfect i ve had no issues with it after months of use the only thing was i had to get the latest programming instructions off the company s website instructions were included but did not cover my vehicle no big deal though programming was simple after reading the instructions twice label delivers its promise this book keeps its promise of delivering essential tips from choosing cutting tools to repairing a button hole there are lots of tips to satisfy the beginner sewer while i like the layout which includes step-by-step instructions accompanied by photos this little book could be vastly improved by adding a few more pictures to some of the tips to make them more clear a couple of pictures could also be improved by better choice of colour e g attaching a flat collar which is a glaring yellow and darning a hole which is so well done you cannot see the example stitches clearly enough nevertheless overall it is a very useful book label so far so good this is the oem sp installed in my sentra se and at k miles it is time to replace them after seeing the gaps on the original plugs i am thinking i should have replaced them at the k mile mark in terms of longevity i highly recommend it label is it nu metal i dont remember how i first heard of this cd but im glad i did its a great cd and well worth a listen i dont know if i d call it nu metal do they have a dj in the band the follow up cd wasnt as heavy as this cd and disappointed me label research wow the lack of research is clear within this edition as a student of this period of english history for over years i must recommend that anyone researching this young lady to consider earlier publications label bland this is your run-of-the-mill southern album one thing it was fortunately missing was a slew of guest appearances and skits galore there are a few tracks that stand out amongst the rest but even these are tracks that you could live without hearing it sounded like k-rab supposed father of snap music and this group wanted to cash in on what s hot at the moment and that s subpar beats made by a casio if you re interested in buying this don t have high expectations tracks worth mentioning do the poole palacehit me on my metrosteady choppin label solid guitar stand we are currently using this stand for a guitar and banjo it looks nice and it isn t too bulky which is definitely a plus best of all it s very sturdy label great soundtrack this is such a great soundtrack if you love this movie like my family does having this soundtrack is a must label solder gun needs more power may be fine to burn wood but bad to solder wire connections not fine enough for board soldering or big enough for larger wire label i love this cd i have been listening to this cd for a few months now i fell in love with it the first time i heard it it s both soothing and uplifting at the same time a real plus for me i highly recommend it as a sensory treat and a true pleasure to listen to label boring i am a science teacher and hoped to use this to teach when watching the new hobbit moviethe book was not real helpfulmostly just opinions and and the author talking to themsevles label fast delivery they arrived fast i hope to never need them but just in case i bought packs for the whole family and put them in our bobs they expire in and are individually sealed so i feel we ll have some insurance until then label vital piece of health insurance read about the spent fuel pool at fukushima researched the product and this is the best of the bunch think of it as a dollar per year per person insurance against radiation poisoning given the year shelf life in the event of an emergency be it the fuel pools at fukushima or elsewhere i cannot imagine living anywhere on the west coast or west of the mississippi for that matter and not having this item on-hand if there is a nother nuclear emergency potassium iodide from any source will be unavailable within hours label hope it works hasn t been a chance to use it but i know this stuff will work came in fast and this stuff is legit label great concept poor quality i like the design the colors but the the quality is bad within a few hours of use the stitching started coming apart would not recommend belkin makes a similar product without the button and it is x as durable the quality on this product is not worth the cost label simply the best iron i ever owned or used i love this iron i have been using mine since about march have never had any problems with it but i fear that it willgo out and i can not replace it since it is not being made anymore love the feature to disable the auto-off and the wide range of heatsettings and the long cord the constant beeping is annoying but after yrs i have grown useto it simply the best iron i ever used or owned label a fun way to learn punctuation mr period introduces young writers to his friends there is mr open quotation mark mr closed quotation mark mr comma mr exclamation point and ms question mark among others each of the friends has a place and mr period explains their function in a fun way there are stickers of the punctuation marks at the end of the book that will fit in the blanks of the story on the last page the illustrations bring all the pals to life armchair interviews says what a fun way to learn punctuation there are more than a few adults who need to read this label great kit just needs more products this kit was great the cookbook was very helpful and had great sushi ideas the items were high quality i just wish there were more of them i would recommend it for all who love sushi label great sushi starter kit i was looking for the perfect gift to give my sister and i stumbled on this my sister loves sushi so much and i like the fact that she ll be able to make her own sushi she hasn t tried making her own sushi and i was there when she first used the kit it was fairly easy to use the instructions and all the materials needed to make your own sushi are complete it even has a cookbook and that and a bamboo mat for rolling up your creations i ended up buying another set for myself so now i already have sushi in my menu it s a perfect hobby for a housewife and i m thinking of starting a small business soon of course i will need more complex tools to make more sushi but the sushi making kit is a perfect way to start it off it s a complete beginner guide and it didn t cost me a hundred dollars label awesome for any sushi lover or lovers i purchased this for a christmas gift for my in-laws it is absolutly wonderful all that is needed is the fish and or vegetables i recommend this all the way label hard to use this product is much harder to use than described the receipes are easy to follow but the rolling is very difficult and the insructions were vague i found myself having to turn to the internet to look up instructions and rolling techniques the ingredients were all very high quality but all were available in my local supermarket would not recommend label fun gift if you have someone that is hard to buy for this may be your answer kit has everything you need besides the fillings makes for a fun sushi making night does take several hours though label sushi chef excellent product detailed instructions on how to prepare the rice has a few recipes for rolls would have liked a few more but that s what the internet is for was very nice having everything right out of the box i would suggest using a zip-lock bag or plastic wrap for the rolling mat if you wish to preserve it for future use the sushi i made turned out pretty amazing all on my first try i would suggest this product to anyone who is interested in this hobby label great anniversary gift i purchased this as part of an anniversary gift for my husband we haven t used it yet but he was very excited to receive it and can t wait to use it it was also delivered very quickly label very bad item arrived all moldy inside it had to be broken for some time before nobody noticed the mold before packing for shippment label not bad the kit contains everything you need besides the fish so it is a really great kit makes an awesome gift but i reccomend going to a store and purchasing when it arrived in the mail the lid on the wasabi container was shattered and the rice bag was torn open and rice was everywhere luckily it was all contained in a plastic wrapped packaging so the rice was contained in the orginal packaging but it was a gift for my boyfriend so i was disappointed when it arrived and we opened it we just put the wasabi in one of our own tupperweare container and the loose rice in a ziplock bag label far from like new cd case was cracked in all directions and cd itself had a white cloudy substance all over it not very happy with this purchase label slow confusing frustrating after hearing and reading so many positive reviews of me i thought i d give it a try me has a lot going for it a rich story great graphics and hours of gameplay the only trouble is that the game is incredibly tedious i spent at least two hours at the beginning just running around a space station jib-jabbing with people and getting completely lost in the process they tell you to go here then there then back again ugh then when something entertaining does actually take place they don t give you enough checkpoints one mission i was nearly minutes into then bam i died from a fluke and had to start all over again i really wanted to like me but it s a drag label a lot of hype i bought this game to try and get caught up with the series for the release of mass effect the graphics are impressive and the story and background behind it is interesting my problems stem from the stagnant dialogue and frankly boring gameplay i always feel like i m missing something though as if there s another layer to the game i haven t caught onto yet i m still trudging through trying to find this missing component label fun game despite the wait my only complain was the waiting on the elevators the nxe game install kinda got rid of that but it was too late for me i was nearly done with the game already its a great game though pick it up if you can label immersive rpg combat the battles and combat are exciting and because landscapes change and your armour and weapons can be upgraded combat does not get boring or repetitive leveling up frequently keeps you interested in developing your character for combat dialogue the dialogue is well written characters are believable and interesting storyline this is what makes the game five-star worthy it pulled me in from the very beginning and never let go when i finished the game i just started it right back up and through again and again and every time i did that i enjoyed it more until me2 came out and then me3 which i have not finished if you need fast-paced shooter action this isn t the game for you if you prefer plot and character development you might fall in love with this game s cast and story i did label awful follow-up to kotor let me say knights of the old republic is one of my favorite rpgs of all time the way they meshed turn-based combat with real time was a revelation that no game has since matched but this game was boring as hell i played it for over hours and all it seemed to me was a running simulator with a bad third person shooter mechanic thrown in sure the conversation mechanic was interesting for the first minutes or so but after a while it was like watching a movie i had to also direct instead of just enjoying it generic sci-fi themes also abounded lacking the cohesiveness of the star wars universe for an underlying premise i would say bioware is great at interpreting a story that has already been realized for them but awful at trying to come up with an original concept and executing it in an interesting fashion label boring boring and boring i have wasted days of my life playing this pointless boring game i do not know what everyone sees in this game i kept playing just thinking it would get better but no it doesnt the graphics are great but the gameplay sucks you just have to stand there during endless talking scenes and when it is over guess what here comes another talking scene you feel like you are playing a movie rather than a video game please rent this game before you buy it i am so glad that i did thanks for reading label cd doesn t work it ran up to the point that said clean the cd with a soft cloth and i cleaned it several times still i can t play that is all i can say about this game label great story horrible combat probably the absolute worst combat manuevers ever player is slow to move squad members do not listen to commands game is riddled with bugs one of the most annoying characteristics is that you cannot fast-forward through much of the talking sequences label a great sci-fi adventure one of my personal favorites of all time definitely jump into the mass effect universe and play the whole trilogy of games label best game ever-saved my mind i work a lot and never really had time for anything i went to sleep and would dream of work then i would wake up and work some more mass effect is one of the best games ive ever played being a fan of fable gears of war series the halo series ect and its super cheap so its a must buy and i chipped in the extra cash to over night it label no team boo this is acctually probably more like a stars but i like mos i fell it falls between my solo project and our constant concern as far as quality goes team boo was unbelieveable and was the stand out best album from them while this shows the same creativity and harmonious song writing it lacks the charming upbeat major tonality found on some of their others label liberation from self erudite fascinating look at difficult topic berofsky captures all the complex elements of this tough philosophical treatise excellent scholarship its easy-going style helps even the lay person to understand even its most difficult ideas label scholarly readin very broken down for anyone who needs to write a paper at any level i use it with my students at the middle school level label bookmarks a guide to research and writing this book was listed as used but arrived looking brand new in a very timely manner i have been using it for my class and will be keeping it since it is a great reference for citation for the different styles of writing label excellant seller the book arrived in excellant condition shipment fast a pleasure to do business with sellers like this one in fact we bought a second one thank you label far from exhaustive but well done the one point i took off is for lacking gradual switch to ukrainian as the reader gains knowledge of the language it d ve been great practice and more of an immersion in the ukrainian language this is indeed a very simple book but it sure can allow itself to be one since it s the only book on the market more or less ukrainian is the first slavic language and though had long existed in the doldrums of occupation the trend in ukraine is strengthening it as a national language and it seems like it s heading to be the th most widely spoken native tongue in europe after russian german english french and italian note that it is practically useless for those with prior knowledge of other slavic languages it is oriented at english-speakers label boo we live in germany as part of the military and i was trying to find something that my year old daughter could use to help learn the language this was just awful don t waste your time or money you can youtube the stuff that was on this video and have better luck they don t really give you a lot of time to try and say the word before jumping on to the next word or phrase also you only hear the word once and you are expected to get it from that one time it was painful to watch and we just turned it off not worth your money trust me keep looking and find something else label not worth the money the cd is not by the department of defense so that endorsement should be removed the cd contains information easily found on the web don t waste your money the cd isn t worth it label focus on dhtml too much this book talks lots of basic content about internet if you want to write internet applications you should learn the use of dhtml and asp which i think is the most important however this book focuses on the use of dhtml within visual basic i think it s better to reference other books containing the use of webclass within vb6 after you read this book label the long awaited album is finally here jason levasseur and jerry chapman provide a refreshing change to todays musical scene they write there own songs and play their own instruments take that backstreet boys the new album blends together seamlessly the contrasting musical styles of lavasseur and chapman though only two the sound is that of a full band having toured together for years the new album is tight and feels as if they are singing live for you the songwriting is intimate and heartfelt big sky is magical hopscotch in oz highlights chapman s strong voice spacegirl is hard to get out of your head and the rest of the album does not disappoint don t just buy the cd make sure that you catch them live the next time they are in your town they are a fun act live and this album catches that energy label bland bat this book was disappointing bland flacid superficial pointless except for the bat-neophyte you d have to know next to nothing about batman to appreciate this book it breaks no new ground presents mediocre archive art in a boring way and is a basic waste of money label swing out sister does it again wonderful after waiting patiently for the latest edition of swing out sister to arrive i could not wait to listen to the stylish vocal s of corrine from the catchy who s been sleeping to the haunting vocal s on make you stay swing out sister proves they are among the very best this cd feed s your heart and soul thank you swing out sister-la la la mean s i love you label lahaina eddie kamai did a very nice job in presenting this dvd about the history of lahaina love this town now i know more history a must buy for maui lovers label yuck yes that s my opinion of the white room okay how many times is this woman polly going to faint that got really old her husband tim is as interesting as a dish towel i think my year old could write a more interesting novel and come up with better dialog i could go on about this book but i think the other reviewers have covered it label good product i like the ease of installation of this ink cartridge and it s a lot cheaper than the hp printer ink i used to have to buy label love the machine hate the cartridges i agree with the other reviewer i have the mp500 and this is a very nice all in one scan print copy no fax machine however be prepared to shell out some bucks for the pgi i am going thru about every weeks at a cost of about bucks on very lite print jobs i always use the fast print option there is no compatible as of yet i went thru office depot where i paid per but got free shipping on orders of or more i might have to bring back my epson for my black ink print jobs the other four cartridges are wearing very well this is the last printer i will ever buy that doesn t already have a compatible on the market i am looking into refilling this cartridge with an ink kit however you have to disable the ink gauge on the printer label works great i replaced my electric start with this recoil starter it fit my os motor great little pull starter no more wasting time with batteries for the electric start label interesting applicable and timeless the don t sweat series provides the reader with tools to organize and prioritize ones life with the many different pressures placed upon us in our lives carlson hits home with this short read regarding the balance between our worklives and our homelife broken into extremely small chapters only one to three pages long it is easy to take some time out and read a few chapters appealing to even the busiest of schedules the only caveat is that one might be bored by the continual emphasis of the same points over and over again label the dylan paradox on principle i have never given a live album stars as you are assessing a performance rather than a creative piece of work i very nearly broke my own rule for this cd not only did it preview a very fine album desire it makes a mockery of the live greatest hits trash he and others have mostly released i saw a couple of the shows from his critically aclaimed tour of oz with tom petty and the heartbreakers in he was razor sharp but even those efforts pale when compared to his performances on this legacy from the rolling thunder revue buy this cd if you have any interest in dylan it is simply a stunning example of just how good dylan could be when enthused and making music with his mates label wouldn t install this is the second intel pc camera that i ve returned for not being compatible with my system i m running windows me program and on trying to install the camera i received error messages from the intel disk saying that it couldn t find certain files which were needed for installation upon deleting the camera from my system the system froze up and i needed technical help from the computer company to fix the problem no more pc cameras for me enjoyment should not include aggrevation label fantastic the sountrack to a thousand bonfires the sheer beauty and depth of this album is astounding buy iy label the art work everything i expected the price is great for a must have and classic vinyl label maybe great back in the day but today egad i bought this for my husband because he loved oblivion so much i was pretty sad with how dated it was but i guess that s my fault since the game is around years old i m sure it was great back in the day too bad we opened it i wish we could return it label not for everyone i love rpgs both pc and console i ve played the big names and whichever of the little ones i could find so of course i tried morrowind to be honest most people either love or hate this game i can see where the love comes from morrowind is a party of aesthetic goodness it boasts a gigantic world where freedom reigns it also has a great community backing it up with fantastic unofficial add-ons however i can also see where the hate comes from i do lean to that side after all the combat and magic systems are terrible the npcs are lifeless and their dialogue equally drab with freedom comes a feeling of aimlessness don t get too caught up in the game of the year title or rave reviews bad reviews neither if you get the chance try the game first that s the only way you ll know where you stand keep an open mind but don t think that you have to like it label one of the best morrowind is an absolutely wonderful game with great music great landscapes an epic story and pretty entertaining gameplay to boot i can t call it perfect mainly because of the fact that like so many other bethesda games it s full of bugs many of these have been fixed by the community and morrowind has an absolutely mind-boggling array of mods available the mods allow an almost infinite of in-game experience and i heartily recommend this game to any fans of rpgs out there label very helpful highly recommend this book is worth it even just for the test-taking tips it has helped my son immensely label wrong reason could have had better description this product is for xbox memory units not hard drives as apposed to the description if used for the correct reason it appears it would work i got a full refund though also this is an unauthorized product made by datel in case you wanted to know label xbox transfer kit doesn t work doesn t work won t transfer files to your pc there is a known problem with it the info has been posted on the web manufacturer has released a patch to fix it and the patch only works for some people we wasted our money on this one label excellent price it took me a lot of reading and talking to others before i decided on this dual point distributor while the unilite distributor seems to be a quality product i decided against it because if it fails on the road you had better have a replacement in the trunk ready to go because you probably won t be finding a replacement without ordering it the stock dual point distributors have worked fine for me for many years and i see this mallory as being a huge improvement over stock because i am running multiple carbs and a long cam for the street i do not have any vacuum anyway and this distributor has a large range of initial timing advance i have not run it yet but will do so well before the manufacturers warranty expires i shopped all over for price and found amazon s price to be the lowest and the no tax and free shipping was just icing on the cake label newmans own i am never disappointed with any products manufactured by paul newman these chocolate-chocolate creme are very good try the hint of mint as well label when chocolate nutter butters went away i was sad but then i found chocolate peanut butter newman-o s and everything was right with the world again in terms of cookie satisfaction that is i prefer to pull two of them apart eating the two naked cookie halves then smash the two halves w peanut butter together to make a double stuff newman-o in my humble opinion there is no finer store-bought cookie enjoyment experience available on earth at the current time this is what you wave under my nose to make sure i m really dead label leave this one at home when going to the beach bombay time is a horrible book reading it was a waste of time and a test of patience the book deals with no real issues but does hit you in the face with the indian gosip train of family and neighbors there are so many people meddling around with one anothers affairs that it becomes a frustrating read rather than providing an escape from the bickering and mundaneness of life this book whips you right into the thick of it there are countless writers from the subcontinent that have done wonders in the world of literature sadly ms umrigar isn t one of them label wrong item number on dscreption on the page the item number is but when i got it it had another number which is it came not finally it does not fit my device label one star is that guy insane i can not believe the sanity of any person who gives this album star and wants to give it stars this is tmbg s best album by far leaps and bounds ahead of flood which is weighed down by too many generic mediocre songs and the simply terrible particle man tell me is star applicable to any album that contains the following songs the statue got me high i palindrome i the guitar see the constellation space suit narrow your eyes hall of heads and of course the almighty fingertips that alone makes it worth the price of the album i think that person should rethink his or her judgement of this album because despite what people say weaker than flood blah blah insert untrue stuff here this is truly tmbg at their peak both johns contribute equally great songwriring here label very underrated mc grand puba is one of the most slept on mc s ever he had the skills to go from different styles and musical backgrounds with ease this album is very east coast and has that whole vibe and built back it up baby what s your name and check it out with mary j bliege who puba was on her debut album what s the are tight cuts still a tight set label an important story this book is well written interesting and sad but important because i think this story is not well known i e the situation of the jewish families in that city in england i also loved that the author included pictures of his family in the book label not as advertised advertised as in very good condition arrived stained with red liquid wrinkled hard to turn pages coming apart i read it then trashed it only book i ve ever trashed hate to see your acceptable rating label the invisible wall so far am and about through the book dull and boring but i ll stick with it anne magnolia label cute i am a figure collector i payed less than bucks for this figure it came in time and very well packaged the figure is well made and very cute paint quality is good and the figure stands about inches if not a bit taller great product for a great price label bright but will change the color of housing when off i got these because i thought it would be nice to have brighter back up bulbs but because they are blue they really darken the light housing and make it look well blue more than i anticipated they would then i tried them in the red brake light side and even there it darkened it to a ruby red that looked funny because of the blue color they are nice and bright when working but unless your looking for a blue lens housing look stick with a clear amber chrome bulb also pretty pricy for a small simple bulb label phish mozart for the rock generation i personaly dont think phish could ever go wrong and maybe its because they allow themselves that freedom but this album in particular interests me because it takes me back to childhood and feeling good and about probably nothing at all it couldnt ever hurt anyone to be happy for no reason but as i heard it said once and i ll repeat it for all to hear phish is like icecream for the ears label so its a silly one get over it yeah ok so this is not the best phish studio realease but if you open your ears a little lawn boy is a fun little ditty to have around phish has proven to be quite versatile through the years and that makes them a choice rock act lawn boy is full of that vesatility that only phish can convey a must have highlights include split open and melt a classic in live format bouncing around the room also a live classic the siily but fun my sweet one run like an antelope the peculiar and quirky bathtub gin and the squirming coil not a cd for first time phishers but a cd not to be missed enjoy label childish i found the characters to be both superficial and extremely unreliable the dialogs are very disappointing often shallow and unsophisticated unfortunately so is the plot label buy a size bigger i just got mine today and the fell well made and comfortable my only complaint is i didn t listen to the reviews and order one size up i ordered mediums which fit but a large would have been better i think next time i order i will order a large maybe that will fell a little better label good its a fun game but a little confusing at first but then you get the hang of it graphics i feel could of been a lot better i consider it a hassle to aim the gun every time you play or having to set up the infrared sensors the gun is not cordless whitch was not appealing together with the gun color bright orange other than that is a fun game to play label superficial and short-lived if you think that playing this game will fulfill any of your overly nostalgic memories of playing time crisis at the local golfland then you d be sadly mistaken the gun does not seem very accurate and has somewhat of a lag time between where you aim it on the screen and where the reticle appears plus the arcade-shooting portion of the game is very very short the added fps mode is insipid and feels like it was just tacked on to make this a complete game all-in-all just a two-star product i would only purchase this if amazon which is rockingly awesome had it for about again label almost perfect my copy of electric wizard s come my fanatics was supposed to come with a bonus called demon lung the record sleeve even has the lyrics to the song printed inside the product description said it would come with it i guess its okay though i would prefer to have that but the lp itself is wonderful so i m not hatin label another save the wild horses book why does it seem that the horse story get s twisted into the youth of this country this is more propaganda to save the wild horses i am tired of this agenda being fed to my children label great seller unique product i loved this product it brings out the heart of the new orleans and the surrounding areas i would recommend this product to those who crave the tastes of this region but live out of town nice coverage of the local food products that make this area famous good job to john folse label usb hard drive adapter used time the connector was bent upon arrival and had to be bent back in to shape to properly connect to the hard drive pins i would say the cord is pore the power supply would not power up the nd time i went to use the adapter still on the first day i would not recommend buying this particular adapter label waste of money i bought this product last week the ide works great but the sata is junk i can only assume that the usb does not provide enough power to support a sata drive do not waste your time or money on this spend a little extra cash on a acronis adapter label poor construction i am on my second adapter on the first one one of the wires for the ide power plug came loose they were very good about replacing the unit on the second one the plug that fits into the ac power adapter is loose and i have to hold it so the power to the drive stays on on both units the pins for the ide to sata power converter are loose and wiggle around making it hard to fit into the power cord overall i would say that this product is poorly made i guess you get what you pay for label good looking but useless this wrench is not working at all when i got it i figure that i need to buy a handle then i tried the handle together with this wrench guess what i can only unlock the filter and couldn t lock it the people in the auto parts store laugh out loud at me after i told them how how i paid for it the expense to send it back can let me buy a useful one from the store very disappointed label sounds do not match at all i just received this soundbox the sounds for boxes that are supposed to match do not and the sounds for different boxes that are not supposed to match do kind of surprised as this is not rocket science this product i should add is well made the boxes are sturdy light and easy for small hands to hold onto both my yo and my month old enjoyed picking up and rattling the boxes however it still does not do what it says it does match sounds and then be able to check your performance by color matching it s going right back from where it came label my first phish cd and still my fave this is cd is incredible you enjoy myself and fee are of their greatests if you ve never heard phish take a chance on junta label leaking lacrosse chinese boots the left boot had a leak right out of the box not a big leak but enough to make my sock wet made in china tells the story at one time lacrosse boots were well made and had a long life now i get anywhere from six months to one year use out of them label sugar recipes there are recipes in the back of the book that call for up to a cup of sugar yeah white sugar need i say more it makes no sense label not a magic bullet but close this book is not a magic bullet to ending food cravings you still have to be motivated to change your lifestyle and eating habits it does present the most reasoned arguments i have ever come across in a nutrition or diet book and the advice dr barnard gives seems to be out of genuine concern and well-informed many other nutrition books i have read are almost abusive in their approach and language toward the dieter dr barnard uses a sensible logical and caring approach that really works as long as you are committed label amazing source of information this is a great book for those who are interested in becoming vegan even if you aren t it provides some really interesting information on why we crave the foods we do for the person who said we crave meat and cheese because we need the nutrients in them you obviously didn t read this book and you re still hypnotized by the propoganda from the meat and dairy industries these foods are not necessities the author clearly states that a supplement is only necessary if you feel you re not getting enough b12 if you don t have enough time to cook the recipes provided in the book then buy a good vegan cookbook or look on the internet if you re serious about changing your life then you ll find a way to do it i m so tired of hearing the i don t have time to do it excuse this is why north america became fat in the first place anyway this is a great book and i recommend it go vegan label how could you not live jimmy smith aaaah the sound of a b3 sounds from my past from the s and s mostly this is a good one with classic smith sounds label worthless the notation for this book is awful completely different from three other math books that i have used before it doesn t adequately explain its own examples even for the chapter review on odes confused me as to what they were trying to accomplish i gave up on it shortly after that even browsing wikipedia is more useful than this book cons hard to understand doesn t seem to use standard notation from what i ve read pros cheap seems to have a lot of material label great voice but lousy album it isn t so much the production or barry s wonderful voice that drags this album down but rather the list of tunes he covers we are the champions hip to be square please barry is much more deserving than that he should have covered half of husker du s new day rising album segue with kraftwerk s pocket calculator and then round the whole thing out with joy division s insight now that would have been an album than again i didn t produce mr williams album so all we are left with is this lack luster disappointment label this guy has no talent what-so-ever i feel sick that they categorized this never-was with dave matthews band people should be ashamed to own this album much less suggesting that it should be album of the year label this is a joke right when i first saw this i thought wow greg brady is doing a weird al thing kind of a spoof parody joke then i listened to it and low and behold i do believe he s serious hmmm will this go gold will he do a reunion tour with the rest of the brady s a duet with marsha a rap song with alice oh the possibilities the vocal stylings of greg brady just what we need to usher in the new millenium label piece of junk i got this for a party and tested it out and it worked fine then the day of the party i noticed it ran for about minutes then stopped spinning if i shook it and toggled the switch a few times it would start going again yeah that s really a fun thing to do during a party i tried everything to fix it i tried different new batteries i opened it up and reconnected all the wires i sprayed it with wd40 i tried it both upside down and on the stand i never could get it to go for more than minutes don t waste your time on this piece of junk label perfect i ordered these for centerpieces for one of our annual work events the disco balls run off of d battery which is included and the pin spots need to be plugged in the pin spots are about the length of my hand and the diameter of my fist they are of surprisingly excellent quality i won t be using them for these centerpieces as there is not a plug at each table after reading other reviews i was nervous about the quality of the disco balls but out of the i ordered every one of my disco balls spin and only one lost a mirror tile but it was directly next to the mount and no one will ever notice it is missing i highly recommend these label inspiring this book was a remarkable story of a woman s strength as i recall the shooting of over years ago i remember how eventually we all went on with our lives and didn t think about the ways in which one young man with a gun changed so many lives forever that day at the hilton hotel in dc sarah brady made it her personal mission to put the nra out of business to keep us all safe from the senseless gun violence that changed her life forever i would recommend this book to anyone who is inspired by the dedication and will of others and would like to change the world for the better label be careful when you buy this be sure you are purchasing the correct product supplier idigtoys will only accept returns within days of purchase label coming apart at the seams i bought these shoes for my four year old son and they became an instant favorite he wore them almost everyday unfortunately after about a month of wear the teeth are wearing away and the seam down the back of the boot has ripped after the application of a little super glue he can wear them again but next time i buy rainboots-which will be soon considering these are coming apart at the seams-i will look for another brand label don t get tricked i bought this thinking i could trust the reviews i was wrong this was one of the worst movies i had ever seen i love martials arts films i have all the jet s and bruce s i could find this is just horrible the action and lack of was worse than a kindergarden play with adults it is set in modern times even though the cover as ancient times and there are nude scenes but they aren t even good its a real rip off do not get this movie unless you just have money to waste label great book doc is sassy as ever this of all the books in the series is so far the one that i reread the most label a very enjoyable read shepherd is a delight shepherd s passion may be tomatoes but rather than spending his whole life weeding or watering the author shows us how his hobby has enabled him to develop relationships neighbors friends and total strangers it is a very enjoyable boo label entertaining and absorbing i read casey s revenge during a a recent trip to jacksonville and it completely distracted me from the rather boring ride i found the characters especially casey to be believable and sympathetic the good guys that is the initial scenes when casey is stranded are quite creepy and the ending is chilling i especially liked casey s resourcefulness and generally tough nature the savannah setting is well developed and adds a nice regional touch overall i would recommend it to anyone wanting a captivating suspense novel with some local color take it on your next trip label awful mostly maltodextrin we ran out of jolly time and picked this up at the store tastes bad and is mostly maltodextrin which causes stomach upset for most of my family avoid if you don t like maltodextrin label bland very bland i bought this to try with the newly bought hot air pop-corn but to say it is bland is an understatement i haven t tried it with steamed vegetables yet but it just doesn t make sense to me that i d have to spray butter on the popcorn so i can have the butter-salt seasoning to stick no pun intended label butter seasoning that has no butter flavor it doesn t have a butter flavor it doesn t have much of a salt flavor either so it doesn t taste like butter and you need to add salt the only thing it has going for it is that it is gluten free the subscribe and save price is good better than you can get at the store by quite a bit i bought my single bottle at the big box store for about so if you can get it for less with s s then it is a good deal price wise be sure you buy a single one at the store before you invest in a pack label never been in an inter-racial relationship but i enjoyed reading tag and renee s story in some ways i can see where renee would be hesitant to be seen with tag in public i know when i actually went out with a white friend of mine and another girl i felt very uncomfortable because i didn t want the attention i didn t want people to think that i was dating him all it was was a great game of bowling but even still it felt weird i can read stories and watch movies like something new till the cows come home but i don t ever want to experience it he has to look damn good like tag before i can even say i ll think about it otherwise this book was really good just like the other bj books i ve read label a quick and enjoyable read if you are a fan of standard issue silhouette and harlequin books then you will enjoy ms jackson s new book the author aderes to this genre s basic formula but with a little twist the ir theme added a little flava to the book and i read it in one sitting renee is a social worker and tag is one of manhattan s most eligible bachelors despite the color difference they decide to persue a relationship with each other this decision leads to malicious gossip by coworkers and has renee rethinking whether she wants to remain involved with tag tag does his best to put her at ease but renee ultimately has to come to terms with the implications of their relationship on her own does she follow her heart or bow down to what society dictates is proper delaney s desert sheikh was far better but this book did not disappoint me label don t blame showtime the two reviews before mine say that out of order was one of the best shows on tv but complain that only the pilot episode is on the dvd the reason for this has nothing to do with showtime being greedy the pilot is also owned by hallmark the other episodes are not hallmark has a distribution deal with a large video chain rhymes with rockluster so it had to be done this way if this dvd does well the remaining episodes will follow this pilot received rave reviews and made the ny times list of best programs of and should not be penalized because only the pilot is available so far the pilot stands alone and is awesome check it out label so disapointed je viens de recevoir le dvd et ma grande surprise ce n est que le pilote bad information there s nothing in the purchase of the dvd that says its only the pilot what about the six episodes the pilot is good but i want more label good deal these cubbies are really sturdy for the size but don t expect to put too much of anything inside because they are small the color looks more like a deep dark brown rather than a mahogany but the are still worth the money they look like they cost more than they do label a book to make you sit up and pay attention what a magnificent collection of weird shit from a for abominable snowman to z for ernst zundel and his chronicles of secret nazi polar expeditions this is an amazing compendium of the weird wacky and wonderful phantom ships flying saucers rains of fish frogs found entombed in stone alive and most meticulously referenced anyone with an interest in fortean phenomena needs to have this book the perfect addition to any toilet bookshelf this is a book that deserves to be left open and handy somewhere when you can t sleep in the middle of the night it is perfect for browsing and for making sure you really won t get back to sleep an incredible collection of facts innuendo and wit sure to amaze and enthrall anyone interested in the damned facts label pod is good do yourself a favor and put down the sleater-kinney c d s and what not and pick this mutha up a truly mezmerising c d that melancholonizes its not a real word i know the hell out of you flawlessly crafted and if you know anything about deal s work emotionally stirring her voice will enter your ears and never leave as you ask yourself why you never knew that pod existed way back in like that year itself this album feels almost like it never existed in any case it should evoke odd emotional responses label a pleasent surprise this is a lot different than the pixies which i wasn t expecting the songs and subject matter are a lot darker which is cool and the production is cold and distant which is also cool the songs are much more bass driven which is fine because kim s a great bass palyer and the instrumentation is very spare the use of strings in songs like when i was a painter and the spine-tinglingly good oh really works and raises the songs to a new level also it turns out that kim is amazing singer i don t know why she didnt sing lead much in the pixies i mean i knew she was good but she really breaks your heart into a million pieces in conclusion if your a fan of the pixies or amazing rock music in general you re gonna want this just dont expect this to sound exactly like the pixies label songs for spiritual healing very good music and songs written and performed for the healing of hearts i love listen listen listen return again very much and often used them during the opening and closing of spiritual group gatherings people listen to the songs in such an atmosphere and concentration often get in touch with the bottom of the heart and tears coming up because they are really moved label a sharp kitchen tool we have a set of paula deen knives that have never been impressively sharp then i decided to let the accusharp sharpener work its magic on those knives and magic it is the difference between the sharpened and unsharpened steak knives is readily evident and impressive the sharpener is easy to use as it glides smoothly over the knife blade once sharpened the difference of the edge can be seen and felt immediately the small expense of this sharpener was money well spent label simple is often better i bought this product for myself a year ago in desparation looking for something to sharpen a wide variety of favorite kitchen knives i have tried all of the other techniques from stones to powered knife sharpeners as one who likes a sharp knife when cooking i just wanted something to dress the edge quickly reliably and as often as i wanted to without a lot of hassle after doing my research on the internet i decided to try this a year ago it is nothing short of great it met all my criteria and now we always have sharp cutlery no matter what type straight or serrated edge i even use it on my meat clever i liked it so much that all my family members are getting them as stocking stuffers for christmas this year i ll never have to complain about dull knives when i am cooking at their houses as a gag we stapled a few band-aids on the card before gift wrapping the sharpener it s not a professional sharpening tool but it is quick practical and a real timesaver label amazing i didn t expect this to work for so low a price but i was simply amazed at how well it gets the job done there s not much more to say other than that it works exactly as described two or three swipes and the knife is like new i restored a year old knife with swipes swipes for knives of more recent vintage unbelievable label does the job awesome sharpener for axes machetes and for some knives i wouldn t use this sharpener on a nice knife because it leaves a pretty rough cut and you could potentially ruin a nice blade this sharpener cuts a dull edge very quickly and was worth every penny highly recommended for most sharpening label not sure that it works tried to sharpen my scissors and the tool made them even more blunt i followed the instructions on how to use label excellent sharp knifener for the price i was very pleased to find that this simple little device does an excellent job of making sharp knives rather than moving the knife through the sharpener you hold the knife stationary and run the sharpener across the knife a few times don t wast your money on some expensive prax electric knife sharpener try this sharp knifener you ll like it especially at such a low price label great deal effective product as soon as i got it i started sharpening away the several knives that have been dull for way too long my pocket knife is back into action with a sharp edge which only took me minutes to recondition affordable and effective for sharpening multi purpose knives label save your time and money i fundamentally agree with the kirkus review instead of keeping you on the edge of your seat saylor keeps you asleep in your seat in no manner can he in the case of this book be compared with caleb carr all too often during the development of his plot does he take off on lengthy detours that totally destroy whatever tension or suspense that he is trying to develop i e the female clerks bill the book finally gets moving at the beginning of part iii on page o henry s position as a protaganist is minimal the conclusion is predictable as saylor pretty much broadcasts it throughout the book all in all a tedious and boring book label good songbook this is a good p v g songbook i play guitar and the chord diagrams are listed above the staff i m having fun learning to play some of avril s songs because some of the chords are complicated no pun intended i suggest that this is good for an intermediate player label much too skimpy i bought this book and would advise you not to do so it is much too skimpy there is too much fluff there are much better books and articles around this book touches on a bunch of terms and techniques without explaining them in sufficient detail i thought that by reading this book i would gain a good idea of how to use rose but such was not the case label not true if you are a fan of fictional genocides this is a good read if you are interested in the complete truth you have to read other books in the period mentioned in the book practically everybody was killing everybody else in a country torn by ethnic strife fueled by imperialist foreigners innocent ethnic greeks were killed yes but keep in mind that lots of innocent turks also perished calling this kind of nightmare a genocide is just an inappropriate use of the word label it was jihad what a pity that halo could not not even now name the annihilators the turkish military it was islam this kind of perfect dhimmitude is islam s greatest achievement the complicity of their victims label poignant memoir this poignant memoir written in such astonishing detail is an unforgettable story that will capture the reader from the start sano is like a small but sturdy flower growing in the most unlikely and least advantageous of garden spots in her we see goodness and love survive heart rending loss and the cruel displacement of senseless war i could not put the book down once i began to read it label buy this record you ve found it buy this record linda ronstadt and the ray santos orchestra perform latin swing music the arrangements are crystal clear snappy and crisp her voice her spanish phrasing is flawless the song selection frenesi perfidia is inspired not a mediocre number in the bunch do you like to dance you can t sit still for this music this is not the canciones mariachi music fine in its own right i m sure for some reason people don t know about this record i had them play it in a cd store recently the employees didn t want me to buy it and take it away you ll thank me for this one label outdated this book is racist eurocentric and outdated professor huntington would be well advised to consider that civil conflicts outside the global north are more than a bunch of silly little children waving threatening sticks label shows author s bias and borders on conspiracy theory this book is a bad read book does show that the author has vast knowledge of world history and geography but at the same time brings out his strong biases towards racial and religious make-up of the world the book makes some very simplistic judgments about the historical nature of conflicts and adds huge amount of weights towards some abstract civilizational construct of human life humans are way more complicated and driven a lot by nationalistic and regional concerns than depicted in this book i found reading this book quite a waste of time label somebody give huntington a copy of orientalism this book is racist essentialist garbage strange how huntington s thesis fails to account for saudi arabia the most fundamentalist of islamic states and client of u s power label revenge of the goldfish inspiral carpets even after a few years this album still sounds great to my ears i recall the day i heard dragging me down on a live to air radio broadcast from a local bar a radio station i grew up listening to over the border in toronto was doing and it was a great tune from then on i purchased this album and have been a fan ever since other notable tracks on this album which in my opinion are solid are two worlds collide bitches brew and disappeared i would definitely suggest if you are a fan of the alternative movement from the s this should be included in your library of cds label do not buy a book without flipping it that s what happened to me respect this book conclusion do not buy any book ever without flipping it other s review are not reliable this is the third time i bougth a book based on other s review i repented label great have used this for many little ones always a hit you can t go wrong with this for your own use or as a gift label love this dvd set i got this dvd set as a baby shower gift before my son was born it is a wonderful set of dvd s that i used from infant age until about years old my little boy loved to watch it and it is easy to watch as an adult too when my brother was expecting in september of last year i could not wait to give them the dvd set for christmas it helps to calm a baby and relieve a tired parent recommend it to everyone label close your eyes and let it carry you away if you liked the african-flavored tracks on the soundtrack to disney s the lion king you will love this album not being an expert i don t know whether or not this is authentic african music but i can tell you that it is some of the most emotionally stirring music i ve heard the rhythms and harmonies totally sweep you away i ve tried to use this cd as background music to study by and it doesn t work because i just have to sit back and lose myself in the music needless to say my work never got done until i turned it off and put in something a little bit less involved this is definitely a purchase that you won t regret label print explosion i have used this program for years on my mac i had to upgrade to use it with leopard it s a great product label hands down worst program support i have ever had i bought this program because of the great reviews i read on amazon i have been sorely disappointed some of the major issues are that it freezes my mac that is well above the system requirements for the software has a fatal error and shuts down every time i use the program and none of the templates do what they claim they will do other issues are that when printing an image many times it will print the image on six different pages even though it shows in the print preview it will print on one page i have tried dealing with the support and the response when i finally get one is that it should work they have no idea how to help me other than to say delete the program and reload it they said they would look into it but that was months ago and i m still waiting i would recommend you not waste your money label ultimate treehouses looking at this book is perfect for day dreamers like me it shows the most amazing possibilities for many types of treehouses i haven t gotten to the point of reading the practical information but it is there for when i need it label misleading advertisements brought as little info i know it s just a tiny booklet but i have found the title distinctly misleading and would never recommend it to anyone who is really interested in getting to know even a little bit more about multimedia there are hardly any essentials in this booklet and the tips seem to refer more to what the highlighted manufacturers must be providing to the publisher for zooming in on their various products there is no more info on multimedia to be found in these pages than on the boxes and wrappings of the products themselves and so you re better off just having a look in a store where you can at least make your own picks label a well-written scholarly account obviously this book will have a small audience as the average american has little interest in the history of polish nationalism but for any who are interested in polish history or in nationalist movements in general this is an interesting book what i would say separates it from many other academic works is its readability as the author has a very nice way with words label terrible game this game feels like some amateurs produced it takes forever to load gameplay is awful this is what makes people hate st person shooters your squadmates get killed for never moving ai is stupid aliens are dreadful in sum if you buy it you will waste your money label artifical overwhelming tangy more like a cheap perfume i was reluctant to purchase scent diffuser online but did based on the reviews which were unanimous there isn t much sense in reviewing a product whose appeal depends on personal taste i wanted however to correct the impression that the scent is pleasant and likeable by default i e has a very broad appeal i certainly disagree lesson learned label good for the price i used this with my sewing machine for real leather sewing and worked just fine the price and packaging is good too label a great therapy source for apd the author rosner provides great suggestions for clinicians working with clients who have an auditory processing disorder label not worth it this is a dvd nick warren mix saeed and palash mix interviews cd set same nick warren mix than the st dvd by the way in my dvd the cd side was not detected even though i could hear it on my cd player well the review i spent like months waiting to find this dvd and when i finally got it it was a big dissapointment yes nick warren is one of my favorite dj s but this dvd is his worst work maybe the mix is not that bad personally i think that the one from saeed and palash is better from what i think they had better released it as normal audio cd s as the images have no quality looks like a home video of a discoteque with some poor computer graphics and some landscapes of ibiza with not a good edition very very poor images and also the interviews with sasha and tenaglia well i think that a minutes segment in entertainment tonight is better label it does get harder this was the first game i owned for my ps2 so needless to say i kept playing it it has amazing graphics solid very cool controls good effects and music and it is a great mulitplayer game my gripe with the bouncer is the length it took me an hour to beat the first time and every time i played through after that trying to squeeze a few extra play hours before it go boring it still hasn t it got increasingly frustrating the bosses get tougher every time through and if you choose characters in certain combinations you can get new characters for multiplayer and new story pieces so regardless of the length and ease of playing it through once the game has a decent replay value and i recommend it as a first ps2 game label going gone i will start off by saying short hrs max the concept of building up your characters is nice but not worth playing through times to max them out also the story lines for each character aren t worth playing them through either when you ve seen one you ve pretty much seen them all except for a few scenes and different phrases the graphics are nice which they should be expected more from square but wait i usually do and they usually don t label bouncer streets of rage with too much down time i love squaresoft and this is a good game but the fact of the matter is that you ll spend minutes playing the game followed by minutes of video and story developement the actual gameplay is a little sluggish and a let down on the upside the graphics are a squaresoft standard of quality so if you don t mind getting into a game and taking breaks every few minutes to watch cutsceens you ll probably like this one label worst game ever squaresoft needs to stick to rpgs only all you do is watch a movies fight for minutes then watch a movie again and then minutes later the game is over and the fighting sucks too you just mash buttons and get double teamed and you fight with two other guys and if they kill enemies while you are not in control of them you dont get any experience this game could have been so good the characters and graphics are beautiful but it seemed like squaresoft decided that gameplay did not matter at all they could not pay me to play this game ever again worst game i ever played label did not live up to the hype as many squaresoft fans did this past weekend i purchased the bouncer all the advertisements and previews made it sound like game of the year however it was just a mindless beat-em-up with an okay storyline i beat the game in hours and in one day i unlocked all the secrets no challenge here at all it was visually stunning the first game to really harness the ps2 s power but as an avid final fantasy fanatic i thought the gameplay was a poor job by squaresoft label boring good graphics bad camera and boring fighting system make this game a real snooze-a-rama this game is worse then the old arcade game final fight no weapons no interactive backgrounds even gekido for ps1 has this label too short poor gameplay terrible acting dumb script i like fighting games but this one is really bad the many cut-scenes totally destroy the momentum of the game the acting in those cut-scenes is soooooooooooooooo bad that it becomes funny unintentionally in a cult-movie sort of way worse the fighting is slow and boring the way the characters walk around is terrible the ai is very dumb there is no challenge whatsoever in this game you don t need skill you don t need wits you just need patience to sit through this ordeal label the bouncer is a blast the bouncer is a short game but not a bad won i think people are expecting more of an action game but it s really more of a fighting game think of the bouncer as a fighting but with more than one person to fight at a time label awsome look but game is very lacking the movies and grafics are very well done and over all the game looks nice but the down side is that the game leads you by the nose from fight to fight showing you what you do without any control of movement or even what you say it is basically watch a clip and then fight the first time through you can beat the game in about to hours and its faster if you go though a second time rent this game before you even think of buying it then when you beat it a few times you can decide if you want it or not label the bouncer is a bigger disappoinment than nfl gameday this game is terrible there is only like and a half hours of gameplay and like hours of cutscenes the combat system is no good you can only do about moves with each character the storyline is terrible a girl gets kidnapped and you have to go rescue her the only good part about this game is the graphics bottomline is don t bother with this game don t even rent it label bounce youre way out of here i should start out with saying that this game is not a traditional game from squaresoft it is like a jazzed up version of streets of rage or something it has many good things about it and many bad things first off graphics are amazing and dialog sounds different instead of having that robotic sound to it by all means this is a great game it s got story it s pretty fun and it has the hugest replay value of any game ever however the game is extremely short about an hour or two depending if you skip movies or not and after beating the game a few times the only fun thing to do is battle it out with a few of your freinds i would like to have seen more rpg elements in this game instead of movies then fighting if you want to showoff your playstation or you have some freinds to fight with then this game is for you however if you are more of an rpg-er and not much for just battle games then just rent the game first label added security hadn t had any problems with my shed up north but wanted to beef up security a bit excellent product like it a lot label excellent book this is a superb book definitely in the tradition of conrad s heart of darkness it explores into the minds of men not many women in this book who find themselves by choice in dangerous parts of the world parts of this book though are not for sensitive readers label stainless grill bars don t know about the flavorizor but they do the trick keeping excess drippings off the bottom of the grill and it diverts the flames evenly label wrong item description the photo of this item shows a full set of bars what you receive however is only long bars label is this a joke a floppy disk really when s the last time anyone used a floppy disk for anything other than a coaster i don t care how amazing this microcase software is if it can t be adapted to a cd then it s completely worthless you can download the software at the wadsworth publishing website but if you ve got a mac forget it assuming you can find access to a pc you can download the software but there s still a cd that has workbook pages that you can t download without the floppy disk hopefully this publisher will enter into the st century soon but until then pray that your institution is smart enough to require a less archaic book with usable software label awesome book don t let the brevity of this book fool you packed in its small package is a ton of inspiration i purchased this book in preparation for starting a new boy scout troop but this is great for any father mother youth worker grandparent or anyone who ever comes into contact with children and youth i ve passed this on to other scout leaders to read its main message walk the walk and then encourage the young people who are watching you to do the same label the not-so-sillymarillion i just didn t think it was funny i love tolkien and i love parodies but this just didn t do it for me i ve read funnier parodies of tolkien s work on fanfiction sites i think the best word i can come up with for this book is tired and did i mention it wasn t funny label horrid tries to do too much and becomes tedious bored of the rings was much superior in lampooning the work lord of the rings because the authors didn t try to do too much label apsaras self titled songs include apsaras hizashi no nakade children of the sunshine kinimo tomenai don t turn away ashiitani the search misato aruhi no kaze journey with the wind label it rulez this is just the best cd if you like drum n bass progressive dance music or even if you like progressive hip hop this is the sh t maybe if you don t like drum n bass you will after hearing this top notch production awesome dj ing and song selection and sublime freestyle lyrical madness i sing this stuff in the shower it makes me happy to be alive nuff said after this buy all the other ones too they all rule progression sessions with drs blame prog sess vol vol promised land vol you just can t get enuff you re listening to the past the present and the future label why buy anything else i am running those in my v8 l ford and my v6 l dohc ford there is no question that iridum tip and platinum ground disc will last longer and maintain the same gap why would anybody buy anything else especially when is so labor intesive to replace those in the first place label album s dream one of the best albums ever directly from the best times of nick cave and the bad seeds full of rage passion and hear yourself label definitely worth a listen a frend of mine loaned me this cd four years ago and i ve yet to return it some dull spots but enough rockin beats to keep it in rotation swipe it if you can buy it if you must but add this one to the collection label tried many piaa wins i have tried many brands of bulbs over the years piaa comes in first they are bright white last a long time and well worth their higher price label the color book is not likely to be helpful the color book claims to have color combinations for your home i don t know how the publisher did the math but you ll never squeeze more than a couple hundred combinations from this book that may still sound like a lot but it isn t for each room you get maybe color combinations and that s if you tear or cut out the pictures and assemble your own pictures from the snippets which is what you d have to do if you want to get any use out of this book for a color it gives at most three shades which is far from adequate since every brand of paint has at least shades of any color and using a different shade can give a totally different look label do not buy i just drove through minutes of traffic each way to pick up this filter after my first marineland filter was discovered to have a structural defect soon after unpacking this filter i discovered that a crucial part was missing and hence the entire filter system is useless save yourself the hassle and buy a system from a reputable manufacturer never again a marineland product label a let down i agree with most of the input stated by others the album is a huge let down this is very soft and popie compared to what they have produced in the past it s not a bad album but if your a long time listener of ffaf be prepared for change the screaming and fast guitar playing is not there label the best cd i own this is without a doubt the best cd i own since i purchased this cd i have purchased more than additional cd s hoping to find one with as many excellent songs as this no luck yet label what a freakin sellout man this guy sold out many years ago unfortunately like crusty the clown and neil young nick cave puts his name on everything as if the world is one big advertisement for his profit musically this album is pretty boring pretty boring indeed just like all other cave s ventures into the netherworld of goth-rock on the positive side though cave sounds a tad more upbeat so perhaps he s finally beaten back that hernia he s been suffering so many years for true rock check out the coming limp bizkit cd plus i heard van halen has a new record coming soon is roth back in the fold this time have fun label the best chair ever this is the most comfortable chair you ll ever sit in its great for people who have back problems too the chair is designed to fit the human body the other great feature is that the mesh lets rain pass through it and its almost instantly dry i love this chair label owned for years i bought this off amazon years ago and while it is very comfortable it does not stand the test of time within the first year it started to rust and the cording is very stretched out i ve had better luck with a cheaper knockoff i bought at bj s label norton tool the stone has the perfect shape the large side is great for mower blades and the tapper ends work well on pruners and axes easy to use and no injury to fingers it s a label please update this book i used german in lessons when learning german and found it superior in many ways to other introductory books and i looked at a lot of them however there are a number of shortcomings which make it less useful than it could beshortcomings that could be easily remedied first there needs to be a section in the front of the book on pronunciation second there needs to be an alphabetical list of vocabulary words in the back of the book third it needs to be updated some of the slang is a little outdated fourth it would be great if it had an accompanying cassette or cd if these four things were done i think it would be by far the best introductory language book on the market it has great strengthslogical bite-sized lessons useful vocabulary clear explanations of important grammar but it needs a bit of tweaking adrienne are you listening w w norton company are you listening please update the whole series label when i got hooked rift was actually the first phish album i ever heard i believe everything from junta to a live one is great but i think rift really is possibly the finest one concept album or not it just flows so well from the openers rift and then fast enough for you to the excellent closer silent in the morning every song is in the right place and the mid-album tracks horn wedge and mound are all fun jams too as much as i enjoy the dead blues traveler and black crowes there s just something about phish and rift it s just alot of phun label rift it s nothing great rift was the third phish album i bought following farmhouse and billy breaths and i must say that after listening to those two rift is not all that great i does however offer some great guitar work but as with most phish albums it lacks lyrical creativity but i don t want to sell it short musically this is an all right album so if you have some extra cash and you like phish go ahead check it out maybe you ll see something here that i didn t label no more insanity trying to manage my pot lids was making me crazy i have to stack some pots so leaving their lids on is not really an option and the resulting craziness of lids everywhere and always being in the way is now a distant memory i have flat-like stainless steel lids and this works phenomenally now i can finally stop pulling my hair out label still going on strong cant wait for tha next one ja is still my nig a some people would not say it when ja was all over tha radio from to at least most was fealing him as to now when came on tha spot most people turned on ja and join cent band wagon no diss to just getting my piont across label the best album of ja rule ever i bought this album and its great the best songs are last of the mohicanswonderfulnew yorkget it startedr u l e gun talknever thoughtlife goes onwhere im frombout my business label this is the same old ramble ja can t think of anything else to spit except the same old recycled garbage he hasn t rapped about or said anything new in any of his cd s i wouldn t spend a dime on this cd but if you like no talent whiners then this is the cd for you label he is a wanksta and i smell pussy he just needs to retire screw this non-gangsta no real g sings they just rap god label solid album what a wonderful recording one of the best to be released so far this year i can t get it out of my cd player this is feel good music but not in a cheesy way good up-beat pop rock it s a nice cross between anberlin s vocals and relient k s hooks and lyrics that have a great message you ll want to be singing along definitely check this out label disappointing when i picked this cd up at my local christian bookstore i had heard very few of run kid run s songs as i started to listen to the cd i was expecting to be surprized by how good they were as it was i was slightly disappointed this band is nothing new they combine relient k s music with vocals from green day hawk nelson olivia the band and relient k that s it all of the songs sound the same and nothing stands out the one song i like is wake up get out over all this is who we are is not worth the bucks i paid for it label its ok but not worth the money it looks cool but we haven t really had reason to use it much the burner is really affected by wind i tried to stir-fry on it and the wok didn t even get hot after minutes because it was a little windy out if i could do it again i would not get it the summit grill is great though label sci-fi trip exploration of identity and self-loathing this is a pretty fascinating book it s about this paid assassin who wanders around the galaxy on an assigment to kill clones and having to impersonate a different personage or infiltrate a different society at each stop the guy is a matricide patricide too and we get this very inventive sort of travelogue of different societies and identities he goes through never really knowing the point of his mission but eventually getting to a place called pleasure land where he s supposed to whack the kingpin and a nice surprise ending ensues the most interesting part is when he has to be a god a criminal a monk an ambassador and what not and the incredible scene where the mob boss explains his philosophy of lying openly to the women he lies to the writing is really good and it really keeps you turning the pages and unlike most scifi these days it makes you think i recommend this book very highly label seems like a different set after seeing the butterfly cups i really thought the saucers would be just as nice they don t even look like they are out of the same set label helpful to this r s can be helpful to anyone who panics at the now-popular idea that we must find our one true passion or mission in life when there are so many ideas we d rather pursue and so many new ones we haven t even thought of yet some people just are not wired to focus on a limited number of activities interests and that s ok label what s with all the good reviews this is where the band as well as most s bands began to commercialize their sound this is rock music plain and simple and this has nothing to make this considered metal sorry but i don t see what the fuss is about this cd sucked anthrax with joey belladonna is where the band really shined and was real metal yeah i admit the whole rap thing sucked horribly but still for the most part anthrax was truly heavy band with joey but with john they really slowed down label too good to be true i thought what a great bargain i found this movie i totally loved but when i got the product it could be watched on my blu-ray dvd player as it was made for another region the company should notify you when your ordering that it won t work on american blu-players as it is made for another region which this is the first time i heard about not being able to watch a movie cause what region it is from the site should explain about why there movies don t work on usa dvd players label love this movie great movie i didn t know what to expect but ended up enjoying every minute of it some of the humor is slap you in the face funny while other parts are quite subtle and touching i ve seen it twice and will be watching it again fun moviei m sorry that this movie didn t get the rave reviews that greek wedding did because this was a fun forget-your-troubles movie i never got bored and my tickle bone loved it too also recommended greek wedding to wang foo thanks for everything label power of one continues the prospect of reading plus pages was a daunting task but one which became progressively easier as i became engrossed in the book courtenays strength lies in his vivid use of words powerful always comes to mind when i think of him as an author as with the power of one it does not pay to consider the likelihood of the plot too deeply we all need a hero which is what fiction is all about like previous comments two things grated namely rehashing the power of one plot for new readers and the lack of continuity at times where the flow did not seem to be there both detracted from the book that said it was a very good read and one i wouldnt have wanted to miss label wonderful movie being in the usnavy myself i have met and known many navy seabee s i greatly enjoyed watching this john wayne movie i respect the can do reputation of these individual s even more now label the real seabees john wayne is terrific as always from the standpoint of telling the story of the seabees role in ww2 this movie is well worth watching but the plot and love story were very hollywood-ized and silly and william frawley doing calistenics is laughable label this thing sucks first of all i had a hell of a time finding a lug nut that would fit under it once installed it fell off once but i found it then after the winter it came time to rotate my tires and the lock was jammed luckily it only took the back of a hammer and about minutes to pry the whole thing apart proving it worthless but saving me a lot of trouble label crappy lock very poor quality dont buy it it doesnt lock well the key is poor quality just a bad product oh my gosh its forcing me to write twenty words for the review but being so wordy it will not be clearly stated its crap label what a waste i would have to agree that this book is nothing but common knowledge with commentary i could have written this book come on it doesn t even give how-to s or anything worth spending the time viewing very disappointed this is the worst bucks i ve ever spent label powerful alluring amusing tragic cave and the seeds are the proteges of no one unique and inexplicable what first sounds like a jangling garage band becomes more and more profound with each listen many people may be considering buying this because of the prevalence of the swooning excellent red right hand and although that is the finest song on this album everything else is of such exquisite quality that you re certain to find a new favorite do you love me is powerful and irresistable nobody s baby now is quiet and majestic i let love in is hilarious and miserable at the same time and permanently infectious and do you love me ii is unforgettable if you re looking for something easy to listen to i cannot recommend this i refrain from giving it stars only because it is such an acquired taste but once your in cave s world you ll never want to go back label make sure it set up properly i had this last week and was very excited to show up at the back yard under morning sun unfortunately one screw was broken anyhow and i didn t notice it is just fine after two to three times on off and turn back on the chair i was amazingly falling down to the deck floor like slippery on the ice that is it now it is working fine and lovely but the back is still in pain label not for the rver booklet only describes the downhill grades i am interested in how steep the uphill side is and can only attempt to read the descriptions in reverse pub also missed some fairly steep grades in wy and ut on booklet would be worth the money if a bit more detailed and consistent verbage remember we rvers need to know about uphill grades label love the rechargable battery i have had this monitor for over years and it works great my favorite feature is the rechargable battery our old one had aa batteries so we always kept it plugged in we plug this one in at night in our bedroom and let it charge then all day we can take it where ever we are living room downstairs outiside also because of this i have found no need to have a double reciever something we had to have with our old one because we could leave one plugged in downstairs and one upstairs love the monitor i guess i only gave it stars because i don t actually think you need all the channels it seems no matter which one it is on you still get some static at times would buy again for sure but after years ours is still going strong label love em finally a product from fisher price that is worth the money these are the second set of fisher price monitors we have purchased and are loving them unlike the first set we especially love having different channels to select from reception display battery display rechargable batteries low battery alarm terminal reciever disconnection alarm and most of all clear sound and no static we struggled for months with another model of monitors from fisher price and ultimately ended up purchasing these upon recommendation from family we are glad to ditch the other ones and are completely happy with these label mostly good this monitor is pretty good it pick up my little one s little noises so i can get to her before she awakens it does have a clicking sound with it if the reception in less then bars which it is less then bars most of the time as my house is long i do have high praise for the fisher price exchange service i had bought a monitor before my little one was born and so therefor didn t use it until after the day return allowance from amazon was up then after about hours of use the monitor stopped working i was able to send it to fisher-price and they exchanged it in less then ten days no questions asked label this is not a parody if you like weird alternative rock or alternative alternative rock you will probably like this album this album got me interested in ween the first three songs seem to have the most emotion put into them little birdy tender situation the stallion pt after that gene and dean sound more silly for the most part with the exception of sarah which sounds like a pretty ode the silliness works best in the tune don t get close my fantasy which sounds similar to a song by the seventies band bachmann-turner overdrive overall there is something interesting about each song on this album it is a work of creativity label viva guava this is an important album to own if you enjoy trippy music i am a big fan of ween but feel particularly strong about turning on those who like to turn on to its chemical-induced brilliance deep behind the effects there s the same vocal and guitaristic brilliance gene and dean give us live but all your blunted ears need to know is the mind between them will be blown label must read i too read this book as a teen and am now years old i remember it so well and have suggested it to many young people interested in the medical field or just for a good read label too many factual inaccuracies and misleading instructions this book has some potentially useful information particularly suggestions about different scent combinations however it has numerous factual inaccuracies you should insulate your soap to ensure proper cooling fragrance oils used for soap are alcohol-based crayons to color soap some of the recipes involve extremely expensive essential oils that are cost prohibitive vanilla rose for example and the amounts recommended would require mortgaging your home the methodology of soap making is antiquated no mention of using a stick blender instead of hand stirring for example there are much better choices out there such as susan miller cavitch s book dated but still useful and alicia grosso s everything soap book label awesome pure energy i must say this is a great song the lyrics r original and the beat is very uplifting the song is so good that i wish it could have been longer i give this cd-single stars not because the song deserves it but because it lacks remixes but altogether it is worth having if u r a truly eurodance fan dont miss it label phenomenal it s a shame they broke up it s a wonder that the story never became a huge phenomenon perhaps they were recording too pre-lilith these two are phenomenally talented with beautiful voices and music it s a shame that they only have two albums to grace us with label great folk sounds this album is a pleasure for ears the genuine and intimate folk sound of the story is a complete success it s sad that jonatha brooke moved away from this because it was really something they were damn good at label a near perfect album if i could only take a few cd s to a desert island this disc would be with me jonatha and jennifer harmonize just about as beautifully as i have ever heard the lyrics are intelligent original clever and interesting this album has a nice blend of pretty songs and ones that get you up and moving near perfection label for everyone great read i found it to be very well written some health books can put you to sleep liz applegate knows here stuff and knows how to write about it she s smart and sensitive about life she makes it clear and in laypersons terms the book should be read by everyone wanting to learn about nutrition and health thank you liz applegate for making me interested in health again label understanding mcluhan is essential to understanding media mcluhan was not the first to open up the field of media study with the focus on the media rather than content but he was the first to see that all human artifacts create their own context of effects and mcluhan remains unsurpassed in the breadth and depth of his understanding no field of human endeavor goes unaffected by media environments and this generous collection is well suited to the serious inquirer whether new to mcluhan or revisiting him with the onset of the latest manifestations of the electronic agethe web and internet label mcgrath repeats himself again ad nauseum if there ever was a writer whose entire opus consisted of cutting and pasting from one book to another then mcgrath is him blackwell has done an excellent job of marketing his comependium of encyclopedias moographs readers and commentaries a clear writer who delivers his presribed message amazing how little it takes to be an oxford don these days excellent material for the novice his work on justification however is outstanding label we all make mistakes very unhappy after parting with au for a book that i believe at best would get a out of ten for a year school kid amazon should filter the junk they sell this is the second book from amazon like this i won t be making a rd mistake anyway this is a thin book with no color photos very uninspiring i actually think the author is either playing a joke or the editor had a vendetor against the general public all in all extremely dissapointed i want my money back amazon p s i d be skeptical off the other reveiws label i couldn t figure it out i bought this book because i my year old son likes to make candles i thought this would be a great addition although the story behind the writer was captivating i couldn t quite figure out what supplies i need where to get them or how to get started i m in need of easy lists and more step by steps and this book couldn t provide that label one of my faves i can t live without jessica fletcher i need to have this season to complete my collection every night i settle in for another adventure with jessica and she never disappoints label great value gps the good product works very well maps are accurate user interface is effective great display the not so good sometimes sluggish with new route calculations battery life is fairly short i have now bought two i have liked the device so much label get about what you paid for i bought this locally on sale for it freezes regularly near the beginning of a trip which requires reboots jabbing with a pen that s why it gets stars instead of my only other misgiving is that if you miss a turn it often wants you to double back in a big circle other than that it s cheap fast easy-to-use easy-to-install and effective the price makes up for shortcomings vs other models note if you live in an area where gpses are frequently stolen and windows smashed this one is a bit difficult to remove from its mount i tend to leave the suction cup on remove the unit and bring it with me label worst customer support in the history of electronics after purchasing this device we went to their website to upgrade the software well the upgrade failed miserably and rendered the device inoperable so magellan asked us to send it in and they would reprogram it well we sent it in and they completely deny ever receiving it even though we have the tracking information that shows when it was delivered keep in mind that we had to send it to texas even though every single customer service rep we talk to is in the phillipines yeah that is helpful they won t send us a new one and they can t find the old one we are stuck we filed a complaint with the better business bureau stay away from magellan label amazing this is a surprising small yet full of addreses the only problem is that infrequently it gives the directions as if you are coming from the opposit direction label low volumn i have asked the tech support about the low volumn and they said that what you hear is what you get too bad they think this way since i can not hear the directions when driving with the radio on low low this unit is useless to me please check out other gps s before you spend your money label magellan maesto it is the best purchase my husband and i have made sets us on a straight course everytime label the unit stinks do not purchase this unit i was told i would receive free update when i purchased it when the update came out they told me it would cost me i e-mailed them and tried to explain what i was told and they refused to honor the upgrade the points of interest are very limited my wife has a garmin and it is great million points of interests and free update i tell everybody to stay away from them and buy a garmin the only reason i purchased it was the free update the maps are and it was a good price i will never buy a magellan again label great for the price i have used my magellan with great success not being the one for great written directionsit has helped me a great deal my only complaint are the instructions with the packageneed to be more informative re the need to downloador to upgrade label overall good quality overall good service from this little thing here s a few things that went wrong already when going to george washington bridge in ny it suggested a slightly longer alternate route right before entering the bridge it may be that it didn t know of a new shorter path to the bridge no problem there on our way back into nys right after the bridge it lost track of its path and it froze we tried re-entering the address but it wouldn t turn back on only after we reset it did it come back even then with a delay i think that if you need only the basics of navigation and some pois without all the bells and whistles it s a great buy at the price of label just right the packaging for this unit was outstanding i was concerned about ordering such a fragile item online but it arrived in perfect condition picture quality is flawless breathtaking sound is excellent overall it s a terrific value for the money best of all it s not too big and not too little label not a good buy i have a audiovox lcd already and i was shocked at how much better the picture on the audivox was compared to the syntax the product specs say the syntax is a better telivision but the proof is in the picture the picture quality was very poor and the colors are just not normal tones if you plan on hooking up your cable with this tv buy a differnet tv the picture is very poor quality i was very disapointed label distortion in aspect except you ll see a circle as a circle only on aspect the other aspect zoom make the circle looks like an egg no adjustment in vertical or horizontal the manual stated the zoom will enlarge the without distortion but it is not it enlarged more in horizontal than vertical tech support said that it is pre-set in manufacture they can t correct it i need the zoom aspect to watch the wide screen movie i compare it with westinghouse the westinghouse is better more options easier use on remote some credits i have to give to both tv is that no dead pixel label my favorite of michael s work ok let s face it michael feinstein isn t for everyone some people think he s too sappy a weaker frank sinatra and so on that said i think this album is for everyone from his eloquent cover of van morrison s moondance to his own half of april each and every one of these songs is performed with heart and a gentle touch this is very much unlike his songbook albums where he takes one composer s work and does it to death which is what generally comes to mind with michael s work here there is a more eclectic style that gives you a truer sense of the great range and talent he posesses label one of feinstein s best feinstein sings several standards wonderfully but the real attraction for me is his going to songs that are not as well known he has lovely mellow versions of soon time enough for love and i ll be there this is one of my favorite cd s which is always a pleasure to hear label wonderful product my sister recommended this product when i complained about my peeling nails it has worked wonders for me for several years now i hope to always be able to order it from amazon com as one review already mentioned i now have to actually cut my nails off to keep them from being too long label glad that i didn t pay for it i was really glad that after reading elegance by kathleen tessaro that i didn t pay for it i really had high hopes for this book it looked like that it was going to be good book but the truth is that it was not a good book louise canova is a american living in london married to an english actor at thirty-two she acts like at lease fifteen years older until she finds a book called elegance by madame dariaux in a second hand shop this small book leads louise to make some major changes in her life this is really not that good the author left major wholes the story that just didn t sense to me i kept hoping that ms tessaro would fill in the holes but she didn t the reason that i gave elegance two stars is because of the work of madame dariaux who s book will be selling on amazon com in august label no sympathy for this narrator i agree with much of what abby said below this book is very disappointing if you are expecting a fun witty helen fielding-style book you re going to be disappointed tessaro breaks a most basic rule of writing by telling the reader how the main characters are feeling rather than showing it it feels forced but the main problem i have with this book is that the main character louise is very unappealing she comes across as selfish and shallow and self-obsessed tessaro obviously wants us to think you go girl when louise tells us about flirting openly with her husbands colleagues instead i marvelled at how i was supposed to like a character who did these kinds of pathetic things finally the whole premise of the book is weak that by wearing tight clothes and putting on makeup you can transform your life louise may become more physically attractive but that doesn t change the fact that her character like this book leaves much to be desired label very dissapoint that i read this book while i was ready to buy this book one of my friends informed me that she already had it and gave it to me the only precious reading in this book is the first page of each chapter that references to antoine darioux for my opinion is the only information you can take concerning elegnce the rest material is information that are worthless regarding to elegance and i have surely been beglamoured by the tittle label must read for beginners if you are new to blackjack this book will save you many hours of trying to memorize tables and charts contained in longer books braids provides an illustrated easy to use guide to casino play with two simple logical rules for quickly reasoning the correct play of any hand also his explanation of card counting is the clearest i ve ever read i now understand the underlying logic behind the many counting systems out there you will find blackjack strategies much less confusing after reading this book amazon com sales rank today in booksyesterday in books label provides a sharp look and functional too prior to this cover i had one that went all the way down to the ground not only did it make my grill look like a trash heap but a couple of field mice found it worked real well as a ladder into my grill for the winter with this grill cover option my grill looks much better and does not welcome unwanted visitors label i am so glad i never purchased the movie if you have the choice between watching the old versions of the twillight zone and uninvited guest watch the twillight zone my eyebrow was arched in confusion the whole time and all i could think was this is bull the whole movie in theory was a big free-writing assignment the plot s had no rhyme or reason give me beauty is in the eye of the beholder anytime from the twillight zone instead of that ball of confusion label good movie this was a good movie but i caution you to see it and judge for yourself if you look at the reviews listed on this page several loved it several hated it and some were in between which tells you that reveiws don t mean a thing the only review that matters is yours when you see it i thought it was very entertaining and there were some cheesy parts but for the most part i enjoyed it w s label one of webb s best amazon needs to get the bob wills album cover down from the site the one for suspending disbelief would be more appropriate this is far from jimmy webb s last album but certainly one of his best his fans know what a treat this cd was when it first came out first in years after seven years i m still listening to it best songs too young to die i don t know how to love you anymore elvis me and the grand finale i will arise a copelandesque version of some old standard hymns only the genius of jimmy webb could conceive of this and pull it off so well label good album but not his best too young to die and elvis and me are great songs on this one the rest is pleasant enough but not as good as letters words music or and so on which hasn t appeared on cd label amazing this cd is truly amazing no one can sing the hanuman chalesa like krishna das every variation of this song is beautiful and the additional cd of pronunciation is incredibly helpful for those of us who would like to learn how to sing along with krishna das incredible voice every time i play this cd during one of my yoga classes i have students asking for the name of the cd at the end of class this cd moves me to my soul every time i listen to it even my five-year old tells me that listening to his cd makes his heart happy this is a must-have cd label not helped me i used this product as described so far more than half of box of it is gone no positive results at all label hair loss this product did not work for me i saw no difference in my hair after using the entire package i liked the delivery system it was easy to use label constant headache in all fairness the one that i have is probably an older model but it looks exactly the same i have had it for about three years now and finally threw it away the other day because i had just had enough of the issues it constantly binds up the tension knob was a problem i am turned off by brother after this one this new model may be better but i am getting a singer in the future label easy easy to use took us an hour to figure out initially but now comes as second nature delivered timely as usual label great sewing machine the machine gets a from me the only complaint is you can t adjust the speed-its just fast works great its easily portable the price was great also one last thing the instructions are pretty bad i found them hard to understand so i just ended up youtubing the directions on how to thread the machine im a beginner and those instructions had me completely confusef label perfect its simple yet has everything to different stiches to a compact box to put lil tools in a small great size works well the product is perfect label poor instructions between people we were unable to figure out the proper way to thread this machine we read the instructions multiple times and it actually worked for about minutes then became a tangled mess label bobbin troubles my ten year old daughter bought this for herself with her birthday money and has had a very difficult time with it every time she gets it threaded within minutes it is no longer working properly and she has to rethread the entire machine we are taking it to a sewing shop for a review but are thinking of returning it as defective merchandise label glad it worked for others not for me this is the worst machine i have ever used i ve been sewing for over years and have used many different brands maybe i just got a bad machine but it makes me hate sewing very unstable tension is always out of wack and it can t sew through more than two layers of thicker fabric label this machine is horrid fr beginners there is no way to slow down the speed at all it goes full speed or no speed and bunches up the fabric horribly i had planned on sewing on paper first but it was just way fast i returned it don t buy it label mouth pleasing and healthy too wow i am impressed with these snacks a whole apple in each bar and no added suger of any kind i love the convenience of these fruit bars we snack mostly on fruit here in the house but sometimes it s not convenient to carry fruit with you on outings so i ve been looking for something like this for a long time and it s better than i expected much better than most fruit leathers you can find in a health store these strawberry snacks have also been tested by a three and four year old pallet and they always ask for more they re so good i ve ordered more of another flavor label taste like a pureed apple with some strawberry flavoring i can t believe how wonderful all the reviews were of this snack i was expecting a strawberry chewy snack but got an apple with some strawberry flavoring really this is not what you expect it has a mushed up apple consistency neither my husband or i liked this product buy small quantities to make sure you approve i have of them left to stomach or give away label sucks compared to visor this is a palm device and does what normal palmpilots do but not much else if you re going to get a mb unit get the visor solo which is more and supports usb and has an expansion slot for users that actually need more than mb like me buy the mb visor deluxe label oi this is england in my opinion this is a very good box set with a wide selection of oi greats such as the buisness skins cock sparrer combat and infa-riot it contains a box set of cd s with about tracts per if your into oi and and have no money like me this is a good one cheers jesse label small kids need supervision with this one our house is the place to play when these are brought outside the kids love it but kids need to be supervised when this is used kids just being kids will try things which they shouldn t lol my nephew broke his collar bone when he had the ramps too far apart label working hard it s very simple jillian michaels is a beast if you are not ready for this workout it will kick your butt and your legs will be wobbling and sore for a couple of days my suggestion is to ease into it do a couple of sets a day for maybe a week before jumping into the whole workout none of the moves are difficult on their own but put the whole workout together and it s pretty tough for the average person if you want to buy it i d say go for it it will get you the results you want as long as you use it regularly good luck label one seriously tought workout this workout is tough and i like it this video hits all of the major muscle groups and uses the same circuit training techniques that jillian employes in the day shred this is a great add-on to the day shred but don t make the mistake of trying this one first if you are new to fitness if you are ready to increase your stength and stamina this is a great video to add to your collection label it works if you do i have been using this video for about weeks now i do it in alteration with other videos by jillian i have dropped about inches so far of course you get out of it what you put in so i am getting expected results she really delivers what she promises i am an athletic person and she works muscles i didn t know i had if you think you would like her as a trianer on biggest loser you will like her on these workouts label beware dvd will not work on your pc i would really like to try this video so far i have not been able to get it to play it seems to send out some kind of an alert when played on a computer i was able to watch the bonus features which was just an ill conceived infomercial for an electric toothbrush i have heard good things about her line of videos but the expectation that you are buying a professionally made dvd that will play in all devices seems like a pretty basic one label good video i like this video enough though it is on the dull side this isn t any cardio so if someone is looking for that then this is the wrong video the ab section while good made me feel really sick i ve had that happen before when i focus on abs so i won t blame this video for that this is a great video for the arms and thighs in particular label good dvd jillian michaels does a very good job of targeting trouble zones in this workout when i finished i was out of breath and sore all over you really do get a lot of different exercises that target different areas would recommend this to others label no more trouble zones my opinion im i bought this dvd because i m a little bored of the gym at the moment and the other dvd i have is a dance aerobic one and i wanted a weights one for toning it came in the mail on tuesday so i decided to give it a go starting with kg weights it was a hard workout and i exercise times a week it is now thursday days later and i am still sore from it my legs and butt have never been so sore so i know it works i would recomend for beginners to do this dvd the first time without hand weights your legs and butt will still get a great workout i really liked it because i am so sore so i know it works just a little scared for when i do it again enjoy label best toning dvd i use the dvd multiple times a week and boy she still can kick my rear to timbuktu and back love it best dvd out there for toning your body want to look lean and feel strong get this dvd asap label fantastic workout jillian is awesome this workout is incredible i bought it based on all of the great reviews here on amazon and the video did not disappoint jillian keeps things interesting and fun while keeping me motivated i highly recommend this workout label jm i hate to love you i am generally a firm believer and have done different workouts from the firm over the years i was looking for something a little different so i decided to give jillian a try after trying one of her free workouts from my on demand cable workout channel that workout got me interested in trying more of jm s stuff i got this workout based on the reviews and i have not been disappointed this workout is tough and it hurts jillian s surrender move makes me want to give up and her ab work is killer i also like the length of this workout and really feel like i did something when it is done it really does work the trouble zone and when it was over i was sore in all the right places abs glutes shoulders triceps and legs overall i am a jillian convert i hate her during the workout but i love her when it is done label love this trainer i am out of shape and started her minute workouts a few weeks ago this one kicked my butt and i deviated a bit at times and did slightly less strenuous movements for some of them even so a great workout works different muscles i love her theory of never stop moving no rest breaks until you are done label healing angel you will not be disappointed with this cd roma downey with her her lovely voice of the irish and paired up with phil coulter on the piano make this an outstanding cd listening to roma downey will bring you back to the basic values of life that we all have forgotten and wish we could all return to label good it is good and i enjoy it and i recommend it to a lot people my friends and family enjoy it too people of all ages and faith like it label lynne s music very inspirational easy to listen to and beleivable roma has a wonderful voice listen to mine often especially when i feel the world is against me i would certainly recomend this cd heavenly music label loving i have only heard a few things off of this cd i must say that i was really really impressed with it i heard the loving track at a friend s wedding it was so touching and so lovely i know already that i want this to be played at my wedding whenever that may be lol roma downey is a very talented person and i commend her on making this album label finally finally a band that are funny guys down to earth and rock the stage live this album only emphasizes a part of them and it is amazing the music is composed wonderfully and the lyrics show you that they are up there for the music and fans not the money although i m sure it wouldn t hurt so go buy their cd label amazing group from start to finish this album rocks i have seen faktion play times live and each time it has been great quit reading my review and go buy the album then find out when they are touring near your town and go see them label awesome this cd is awesome i play it everywhere im sure my neighbors hate me but oh well this cd is great i have my yo singing some of the songs raisin the kids the right way label original and moving rock faktion is an extremely talented band able to grip you with some very moving songs and also rock with the best of them lyrically their songs will give you something to think about which is always refreshing in this world of cookie-cutter music the harder songs are great on bad-mood days as well but their live performances bring it all together and help you see why they are where they are simply put faktion rocks the house label by far the best band i have heard in a long time i think that this cd band is by far the best i have heard in a very long time it takes alot for a band to impress me and faktion completely blew me away i would very highly reccommend them to anyone and i have already been spreading the word about these guys all over ny i am hoping to get to see these guys play sometime soon i am sure their live performance is better than the recordings and the recordings are amazing to sum everything all up into a few words these guys rock hardcore label greatt cd this is a great cd i first heard take it all away on sirius radio and i had to go buy the cd when it came out the whole cd is good buy it label alright starter yoke i purchased a ch yoke as my first flight yoke i ve had many joysticks and throttles before i was expecting this to be great i ve heard many good things about this products and it is one in a few that are in the price range pros it s usb and installs easily it works with almost all flight sims including microsoft s fsx and x-plane cons it seems to be cheaply made thin plastics it doesn t mount well to most desks and tables that i have tried it on the big disadvantage that i cannot stand is in the pitch axis it s impossible to return it to neutral this is due to the springs not always placing the yoke back to it centered point i do not recommend this yoke to any real pilots it will frustrate you to no end it is however acceptable for simple gamers and children for a first flight yoke i m purchasing saitek s throttle quadrants and looking forward to buying saitek s flight yoke as well label works well and easily plug it in to the usb and go no problems whatsoever and it certainly improves use of a flight simulator label much higher quality than it looks in the picture does everything i want i d never play a flight sim without it feels much higher quality than i had anticipated judging from the pictures i ve only had it for a month so i don t know about reliability yet label good flight sim yoke it is the best flight sim yoke i ever tried my only problem with this product is that i have to use a button for trimming in ms flight simulator the built-in trim does not work in ms flight simulator label great and real i use this the joy stick every day but there is one problem it does not stand on it s own to make it drivable label defective with poor warranty mine was defective and they want me to pay shipping both ways to get one that is not defective label ch products flight sim yoke usb the mechanical design is somehow flawed i expected the yoke to slide back and forward with ease and return to center when released the movement should be on ball bearings for the price of the product instead the yoke return position controlled by springs i am guessing stopped anywhere in a inch location the simulators i use react to this movement and i am constantly correcting maybe i some how received a product that slipped through qc i am dissappointed i could design one better than the one i purchased and cannot recommend this product label way overpriced the pitch sticks so bad that it s nearly impossible to maintain level flight i sent it back and it was returned saying it was fixed yea right all they did was spray some kind of silicone lube on the shaft and called it fixed the pitch should work as smoothly as the roll not worth the money as far as i am concerned label all as it should be i received the book which is fantastic by the way in perfect condition it arrived as stated and on time all is well with this purchase thank you label lose laurie just saw this on dvr taped off cable and was appalled at how intrusive the soundtrack is spalding gray doesn t need a soundtrack never mind one that is as jab-you-in-the-eye-with-a-stick obnoxious as this one the zooming and cutting and background images were also annoying but i think i could have lived with that the music by laurie andersen is almost always unsuited to the subject matter and it is so loud at some points that i had trouble following what he was saying a total miscalculation in my opinion just because they were both in the nyc downtown arts scene doesn t mean they belong together glad to see that i can delete it from my dvr because i can always buy this dvd if i feel compelled to watch it again i don t think that i will though label encouraging informative eye-opener i was asked to read this book by the prostate cancer charity in uk and on first sight my heart sank full of dry medical information how wrong i was my husband had a radical prostatectomy in and has recovered well but i still found encouraging material especially about managing impotence the book covers all aspects of prostate cancer from diagnosis to living with the results of treatment it deals with the medical terms and emotional effects of each stage in a down to earth manner i also really valued the fact that it was written to me the woman it made me feel understood in a way that much of literature doesn t as it all male orientated enjoy reading it as you approach stage by stage and keep dipping into for knowledgeable reassurrance my one regret was that all the helpful contact numbers and addresses were all american label not everyone has a woman to help them i saw this book online and thought who are they writing for i then read it and felt entirely left out the authors barely suggest that gay men exist on this planet and many of them have prostate cancer thank goodness for other books and for helping out of a pickle at best this book uses the word love but does not seem to include me label disappointing i was very disappointed by my first visit to the pennyfoot this is th in the series and the author must be ready to get rid of the characters and it shows the plot is rushed and contrived and the characters were stereotypes one and all perhaps if i had been following the series through several books i would have felt differently recommend not purchasing instead borrow from library label rotisserie experience i recently purchased my weber at a yard sale for i was so excited i went online to search for a rotisserie and found the best deal at amazon com i am extrememly happy with the product label exactly as promised product arrived more quickly than i expected it was packed extremely well and made the trip without any bent corners described as being new it could only have been more new if it were in original shrinkwrap will definitely use this vendor again label great foreign film even if you are not a fan of the death note anime series this movie collection delivers mind boggling suspense and intrigue the battle of the wits the viewer witnesses is action packed and entertaining label could be better the movie was decent at best but they went so far from canon that it wasn t really deathnote anymore the only bright spot was that l won so we don t have to put up with the inadequate heroes near and mellow label wish i would have seen these reviews first this software is absolutely terrible in fact i believe it hindered my wedding planning process the guest list manager is very difficult to work with i would have much preferred a plain excel document to type in it was not at all user friendly and what i expected out of wedding planning software was not at all fulfilled i needed software that would work with a mac so didn t have many options if i had to go back i d save myself and use a free site like the knot and if you register at bed bath beyond they offer a free service that does way more than this software does it didn t even include a decent timeline of what you re supposed to be doing when which is why i got wedding planning software you basically have to manually type everything in i would rate it less than star if i could if you are planning a wedding and looking for software trust me look elsewhere label do not waste your money you can find a better map for free downtown in the tourist center i bought this for an upcoming trip to copenhagen my husband the expert navigator that he is got really irritated with it and refused to use it we found a better map for free at the tourist center located downtown it s pretty easy to find it s the one that has a bakery in the same room save your money don t buy this thing it s useless and overpriced label it works was getting a funky yet sweet smell coming from the hvac system most likely mildew in my brand new car read about this stuff on an audi enthusiast forum but couldn t find it in any of the local auto parts stores saw amazon had it pulled the trigger followed the instructions and wouldn t you know it the smell was gone this was last summer and the hvac system is still going strong i highly recommend this stuff for anyone who needs to clean out their heating ac unit in their car label works as intended it removed the smell but it tends to come back i think i need multiple treatments because the car sat for a while label very helpfull i recently discovered i have a heart condition that affects what sports activities i should be doing being an extremely competitive person that competes in a high level of various sports i did not take the news well this book has helped immensly with tonnes of advice on diets and supplements i have even used it to help out other family members with different conditions from weight loss to high blood pressure label wonderful bowls but price increase of in months i really loved these bowls but there is a price increase in months less than months it makes it really difficult when people are trying to save and yet still purchase items they need in these days and times too bad label good reading good reading i really enjoy reading hannah howell she is an excellent writter i have read most of her books and have never been disappointed label the strange world of public libraries the second book of comics about the mallville public library is just as funny and true as the first if you want to try before you buy you can read their entire archive online at http www overduemedia com or buy a read responsibly t-shirt label cane guard guardian narrow base i bought this silver quad cane for my year old mom she has severe arthritis in her knees and this four pronged cane gives her the stability she needs to walk around she uses the cane everywhere she goes this cane has given her more independence and mobility she definitely recommends this cane the delivery was fast and the price was very good label realy great improvment easy to use no error codes all the time contour cuff is much easer to wrap than other models i will not mention other brand but to say this is a much better unit label love it and it loves me greatest home bp monitor there is very simple to use extremely accurate and top quality highly recommended by my doctor label check measurements before you buy way too small barely fits on an adult head but fit my year-old son perfectly label from a naruto fan this was a great box set it contains episodes all of the episodes were wonderful some of the episodes kept me on the edge of my seat while some made me burst out laughing it was an enjoyable product and i highly reccomend it it also came with naruto playing cards i enjoyed this box set so much i went ahead and bought the next one label not impressed the editing on the dvd is messed up so you have to watch all parts everytime you do you exercise you can t just skip to the exercises this alone makes this product useless label worked awesome i used it on my jeep cherokee the headliner was like a tent falling i took out and prepped the headliner board then sprayed on the glue as per the directions onto foam backing and also onto headliner board let it sit for the time stated spread the new headliner on and it has been perfect ever since did it at the end of winter jan and it went through a lot of days during the summer and never came undone but if you don t follow the directions and put it one before the allotted time it may fail that is why there are directions on the back of the can it is a chemical and needs to cure for a certain amount of time so it will adhere to both parts being glued i love how it came out and i think this glue is excellent label just finished susanna keeps getting better susanna carr s book lip lock was a good read i usually can t find time to sit and read a novel for enjoyment but i was able to keep coming back to this one i was disappointed that i figured out the whodunit at the point that molly was fired but the motive was interesting the whole book was well-crafted and proof that susanna gets better with each book sister switch from beach blanket bad boys was choppy rushed and not good at all i just bought valentine s day is killing me to read valentine survivor and i hope that it is as good as the teaser excerpt label fiskar s rolling craft crate i was very disappointed in the product i thought it would be more usable than it is each pocket that holds the scissors are literally only big enough for the tip of the scissors or a pencil pen the other pockets aren t big enough to even hold a pack of colored pencils i thought it would be great for taking back and forth to my daisy girl scout meetings but it s not who needs pockets for scissors the only great use for this item which i can see would be for avid scrapbookersi think it would be perfect for them label great modest entertainment for families or children under if you are a fan of the classic mysteries including the hardy boys nancy drew or tom swift this modest production of a small town mystery is your cup of tea or evening nightcap funny and hysterical in parts yet engrossing from a young child s point of view this modest production reminds me of the matinee serials produced for the double-bill motion pictures of yesterday endearing fun intriguing this movie is fine entertainment and provides a great theme in appreciating and making the most of your surroundings label great cd judged unfairly tightrope is undoubtedly one of the most misjudged cd s brooks dunn have ever made the ballads on this cd are fantastic ronnie dunn s vocals are magnificent kix s best work to date i still play this cd quite a lot still one of my favorite cd s it s a great cd to get lost in label a major flop what the hell were they thinking this album really takes a nose dive since their debut album did so well fragmented and odd with no real style or substance to this album no good label captivating ms rilling s book epitomizes the true essence of the power of love the story line immediately grabs your attention and easily holdsit from beginning to end the author has captured a very magical mystical feeling through out the entire book i savored every minute of this delightfully captivating story label let down st off i love josh dressed up like nebraska is one of my favourite records i ddnt like this one very much whoever he collaborated with i wish he d stayed by himself instead of the songs on the record caught me but the rest i didnt like hopefully when the new record comes out it will be better label doesn t stick to leather fabric at all don t waste your useless this was suggested to me to prevent my cat from scratching my leather chair and it doesn t stick at all if i even lightly touch it it sticks to my finger and falls off the chair now i remember trying this on a fabric chair years ago to keep my kitten from scratching and i remember it didn t work on fabric either useless stuff don t waste your money find another solution in the meantime i have the vacuum cleaner against the corner of the chair she likes to scratch that works better than this label terrible for countertops this is a terrible product for countertops did not deter my cat one bit from climbing all over the counters i saw her walking around on them like it s nothing worst part is that after the thing failed to do any good i spent the better part of an afternoon scraping sticky residue from all my countertops these strips do not come off clean at least from the average grade kitchen counter surface tried a number of kitchen cleaners and they re still sticky can t say how well this works how easy to remove on other surfaces but for countertops it was no good for my cat if you still want to give it a try cats are pretty different when it comes to this kind of thing i would suggest covering the counters with tin foil first and putting the strips on the tin foil that s what i wish i would ve done other than not shelling out bucks for this in the first place label one of the best projects in the gospel music genre ms mccullough s project this is for you lord is absolutely phoenomenal the writing is great there is not a sleeper on this release the vocals by the family and lawrence matthews are exceptional the video captures the mood and excitement of the recording which was recorded live in jamaica jackie s narrative portions on the video are inspiring and augment the overall production if you buy just one video this year get this one you will watch it over and over i bought the cd the casette and the video with the intent of blessing others with the inspiring music the project was produced by kevin bond with assist by jason white a powerful production duo you won t regret getting this one label all weight watchers cookbooks are tasty seriously i am a very busy lady and love these cookbooks quick simple and healthy label beautiful but impractical the lay-out the photographs in this book were beautiful but there were very few dishes that were practical to cook on a regular basis i consider myself to be an above average cook but these recipes called for too much time and too many out of the ordinary ingredients to bother with i ve tried to find recipes to use from this book but it has really become a stay on the shelf cookbook label our liittle texas stray he said if we gave hin work he d do the best he couldthough he didn t know straight-up about a cowso the boss he cut him out a mount and kindly put him onhe said he sorta liked this little kid somehow little joe the wrangler was called out with the restscarcely had the fellow reached the herdwhen the cattle they stamped like a hail storm as they fledand everyone was riding for the lead amid streaks of lightin there was one horse up aheadtrying to check the leaders in their speedit was little joe the wrangler with a slicker o er his headriding ol blue rocket for the lead at last we got em milling and kinda quieted downand the extra guards to the wagons they did gobut there was one of us missing we could see at a glanceit was our little texas stray poor wrangler joe jack thorpe label uncomfortable these panties were not comfy at all i agree that the front seam cut me in half and rubbed in the wrong place i threw them in the garbage after one hour the other hanes boy briefs were much more comfy but i cannot find them anywhere the looked like real boy briefs and were so easy to wear no riding up or cutting int the wrong place i would not buy anything with a center seam again\n"
